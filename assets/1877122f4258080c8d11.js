e.exports='# Change Log\n\n## Updated Thread Permissions\n\n#### September 16, 2021\n\nThread permissions have been updated and simplified:\n\n- "Use Public Threads" is now "Create Public Threads", which allows users to create threads in a channel, even if they cannot send messages in that channel.\n- "Use Private Threads" is now "Create Private Threads", which allows users to create threads in a channel, even if they cannot send messages in that channel.\n\nA new permission has also been added:\n\n- "Send Messages in Threads", which allows users to send a message in a thread. The "Send Messages" permission has no effect in threads: users **must** have "Send Messages in Threads" to send a message in a thread. This allows for setups where a user can participate in a thread, but cannot send a message in the parent channel (like a thread on an announcement post).\n\n## User and Message Commands\n\n#### August 10, 2021\n\n[User commands](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/user-commands) and [message commands](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/message-commands) are now live! These commands appear on context menus for users and messages, with more to come in the future.\n\nContext menu commands are a type of application command. The "Slash Commands" documentation page has been renamed to "Application Commands" and split out by type to show this.\n\n## Select Menu Components\n\n#### June 30, 2021\n\nSelect Menus are now part of the components API! They\'re the greatest thing since the invention of buttons yesterday. Select menus allow you to offer users a choice of one or many options in a friendly UI-based way.\n\nSelect menus can be used like other [message components](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/). Learn all the specifics in the [documentation](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/select-menus).\n\n## Support for Multiple Embeds in Message Routes\n\n#### June 10, 2021\n\nMessage routes now accept an embeds array in addition to the existing embed field. Bots can now send up to 10 embeds per message, to be consistent with webhook behavior. The existing embed field is considered deprecated and will be removed in the next API version.\n\n## Buttons and Message Components\n\n#### May 26, 2021\n\nMessage components are now available with our first two components: a layout-based `ActionRow` and...buttons!\n\nYou can now include buttons on messages sent by your app, whether they\'re bot messages or responses to interactions. [Learn more about message components](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/).\n\nThe addition of message components means new fields and response types:\n\n- An optional `components` field has been added to the [message object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object)\n- New response types `6` and `7` have been added for [interaction responses](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-type), valid only for component-based interactions\n\n## API v9\n\n#### April 28, 2021\n\nAPI v9 is now available.\n\nAPI v9 includes support for [threads](#DOCS_TOPICS_THREADS), an upcoming feature.  Older API versions will not receive any Gateway Events for threads, so it is important to update soon!  We\'ve prepared a [migration guide](#DOCS_TOPICS_THREADS) to help make the upgrade process very straightforward.\n\nThis documentation is being published early so bots can have at least two months to upgrade before threads launch.\n\nAdditionally, API v9 also removes the `/channels/:id/messages/:id/suppress-embeds` route.\n\n\n## Application Command Permissions\n\n#### April 5, 2021\n\nNeed to keep some of your commands safe from prying eyes, or only available to the right people? Commands now support [command permissions](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/permissions)!\n\nYou can enable or disable a command (guild or global) for a specific user or role in a guild. For now, users will still be able to see the commands, but won\'t be able to use them.\n\nNew routes have been added to support this functionality:\n\n- [`GET Guild Application Command Permissions`](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/get-guild-application-command-permissions)\n- [`GET Application Command Permissions`](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/get-application-command-permissions)\n- [`PUT Application Command Permissions`](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/batch-edit-application-command-permissions)\n\nA `default_permission` field has also been added to the [ApplicationCommand](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/application-command-object-application-command-structure) model. This field allows you to disable commands for everyone in a guild by default, if you prefer to make some of your commands an opt-in experience.\n\n## Large Bot Sharding Lowered to 150,000 Guilds\n\n#### March 15, 2021\n\nThere have been reports that sessions have higher frequency of errors when starting if a bot has joined too many guilds (the gateway connection times out). To account for this we have lowered the requirement for large bot sharding down to 150,000 guilds in order to improve reliability.\n\n## Changes to Slash Command Response Types and Flags\n\n#### March 5, 2021\n\nChanges to interaction response types have been made to support better designs for application commands:\n\n- Type `2` `Acknowledge` has been deprecated\n- Type `3` `ChannelMessage` has been deprecated\n- Type `5` `AcknowledgeWithSource` has been renamed to `DeferredChannelMessageWithSource`\n\nThese deprecated types will be removed and break on **April 9, 2021**.\n\nAdditionally, `flags` has been documented on [InteractionApplicationCommandCallbackData](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-data-structure). Setting `flags` to `64` will make the interaction response ephemeral.\n\n## Slash Commands in DMs\n\n#### February 9, 2021\n\nSlash Commands are now supported in DMs with bots. Due to this change, some of the fields on the [Interaction object](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-object-interaction-structure) have been made optional. Newly optional fields don\'t reflect any behavior changes in Slash Commands within guilds; they are to support commands in the context of a DM only.\n\n## Change to Permission Checking when Creating Channels\n\n#### January 22, 2021\n\nPermission overwrites in the guild channel creation endpoint are now validated against the permissions your bot has in the guild. Permission overwrites specified in the request body when creating guild channels will now require your bot to also have the permissions being applied. Setting `MANAGE_ROLES` permission in channel overwrites is only possible for guild administrators or users with `MANAGE_ROLES` as a permission overwrite in the channel.\n\n## Slash Commands and Interactions\n\n#### December 15, 2020\n\nSlash Commands are here! There\'s a _lot_ to cover, so go check out specific documentation under [Slash Commands](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/).\n\nSlash Commands include some new features for webhooks as well:\n\n- Webhooks can now update previously-sent messages from the same webhook using [Edit Webhook Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK/edit-webhook-message) and [Delete Webhook Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK/delete-webhook-message)\n\nThis PR also documents the `application` field on the `READY` gateway event, which is a partial [application object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/application-object) containing `id` and `flags`.\n\n## Inline Replies\n\n#### November 16, 2020\n\nInline Replies have been added to our documentation. They behave differently in v6 and v8, so be cautious in your implementation:\n\n- Inline replies are type `19` in v8, but remain type `0` in v6\n- You can now add a `message_reference` on message create to create a reply\n- A new field `referenced_message` has been added to the [Message Object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object)\n- A new field `replied_user` has been added to the [Allowed Mentions Object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/allowed-mentions-object)\n- [Message Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) gateway event is guaranteed to have a `referenced_message` if the message created is a reply. Otherwise, that field is not guaranteed.\n\n## Stickers\n\n#### November 13, 2020\n\nStickers are now documented as part of the [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object.\n\n## Gateway v6 Intent Restrictions\n\n#### October 27, 2020\n\nThe v6 gateway now applies the restrictions for gateway intents. This means the new chunking limitations are now in effect, regardless of intents being used. See [Request Guild Members](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/request-guild-members) for further details.\nAdditionally, if privileged intents are not enabled in the application dashboard the bot will not receive the events for those intents.\n\nAll other intents are always enabled by default unless specified otherwise by the identify payload. We have made a support article to explain some of the changes and resulting issues with more details: [Gateway Update FAQ](https://dis.gd/gwupdate)\n\n## API and Gateway V8\n\n#### September 24, 2020\n\nWe\'ve introduced API and Gateway v8! Changes are noted throughout the documentation, and you can also read [this commit in our docs repo](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/commit/545ff4a7883e5eee7ee91d19a5e5d760a0730033) for a full diff.\n\nThe changes are:\n\n- API and Gateway v8 are now available. v6 is still the default for the time being.\n- [Gateway Intents](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents) are now required\n- Removed `guild_subscriptions` in identify in favor of [Gateway Intents](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents).\n- All permissions have been converted to strings-serialized numbers. As such, `permissions_new`, `allow_new`, and `deny_new` have been removed\n- The `game` field has been removed. If you need a direct replacement, you can instead reference the first element of `activities`\n- Channel Permission Overwrite `type`s are now numbers (0 and 1) instead of strings ("role" and "member"). However due to a current technical constraint, they are string-serialized numbers in audit log `options`.\n- `embed_enabled` and `embed_channel_id` have been removed. Use `widget_enabled` and `widget_channel_id` instead.\n- Form body errors have been improved to include more helpful messaging on validation. [See more here](#DOCS_REFERENCE/error-messages)\n- The `Retry-After` header value and `retry_after` body value is now based in seconds instead of milliseconds (e.g. `123` means 123 seconds)\n- The `X-RateLimit-Precision` header is no longer respected. `X-RateLimit-Reset` and `X-RateLimit-Reset-After` are always returned at millisecond precision (e.g. `123.456` instead of `124`)\n- Bots no longer receive [Channel Create Gateway Event](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-create) for DMs\n- `delete-message-days` is no longer available. Use `delete_message_days`.\n- Removed `roles`, `premium_since`, and `nick` from [Presence Update Gateway Event](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update)\n- Removed some [integration object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/integration-object) fields for Discord application integrations\n- Removed `include_applications` from [Get Guild Integrations](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/get-guild-integrations). Application integrations are always included.\n- The following deprecated routes have been removed for better naming conventions:\n\nRemoved in favor of `/guilds/<guild_id>/widget`:\n\n- `/guilds/<guild_id>/embed`\n\nRemoved in favor of `/guilds/<guild_id>/widget.json`:\n\n- `/servers/<guild_id>/embed.json`\n- `/servers/<guild_id>/widget.json`\n- `/guilds/<guild_id>/embed.json`\n\nRemoved in favor of `/guilds/<guild_id>/widget.png`:\n\n- `/guilds/<guild_id>/embed.png`\n\nRemoved in favor of `/channels/<channel_id>/messages/bulk-delete`:\n\n- `/channels/<channel_id>/messages/bulk_delete/`\n\nRemoved in favor of `/invites/<code>/`:\n\n- `/invite/<code>/`\n\n## New Permission Fields\n\n#### July 28, 2020\n\nDocumented `permissions_new`, `allow_new`, and `deny_new` as string-serialized permission bitfields.\n\n## Legacy Mention Behavior Deprecation\n\n#### May 11, 2020\n\nThe legacy mention behavior for bots is now removed, and granular control of mentions should use the [Allowed Mentions](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/allowed-mentions-object) API moving forwards.\n\n## New Properties on Guild Members Chunk Event\n\n#### April 24, 2020\n\nThe [Guild Members Chunk](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-members-chunk) gateway event now contains two properties: `chunk_index` and `chunk_count`. These values can be used to keep track of how many events you have left to receive in response to a [Request Guild Members](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/request-guild-members) command.\n\n## New Allowed Mentions Object\n\n#### March 3, 2020\n\nWe\'ve added a way to specify mentions in a more granular form. This change also begins the start of a 60 day deprecation cycle on legacy mention behavior. Read more:\n\n- [Allowed mentions object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/allowed-mentions-object)\n\n## New Invite Events and Reactions Endpoint\n\nWe\'ve added a new endpoint for deleting all reactions of a specific emoji from a message, as well as some new invite and reaction gateway events. Read more:\n\n- [Delete All Reactions for Emoji](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/delete-all-reactions-for-emoji)\n- [Invite Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invite-create)\n- [Invite Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invite-delete)\n- [Message Reaction Remove Emoji](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-reaction-remove-emoji)\n\n## Rich Presence Spectate Approval\n\n#### February 26, 2020\n\nThe [Spectate](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/onactivityspectate) functionality of Rich Presence no longer requires whitelisting or approval.\n\n## Gateway Intents\n\n#### February 14, 2020\n\nWe\'ve added documentation around a brand new feature: [Gateway Intents!](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents) Gateway Intents are a great way to specify which events you want to receive from our gateway. Go on, save yourself some bandwidth and CPU usage.\n\nUsing Intents will change the behavior of some existing events and commands, so please refer to:\n\n- [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create)\n- [Request Guild Members](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/request-guild-members)\n- [Guild Member Add](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-member-add)\n- [Guild Member Remove](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-member-remove)\n- [Guild Member Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-member-update)\n- [Presence Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update)\n- [List Guild Members](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/list-guild-members)\n\n## IP Discovery Updates\n\n#### December 6, 2019\n\nUpdated our [IP discovery message](#DOCS_TOPICS_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/ip-discovery). The old message is deprecated and will be removed in the future.\n\n## GameSDK Version 2.5.6\n\n#### November 27, 2019\n\nFixed a bug from the 2.5.5 release that caused network handshakes to fail, resulting in no networking data being sent. The networking manager and integrated lobby networking should be full operational again after updating.\n\n## GameSDK Version 2.5.5\n\n#### November 14, 2019\n\nWe\'ve shipped some updates to the GameSDK, including support for Linux as well as the IL2CPP backend system for Unity. These changes also fixed a bug in the [`SetUserAchievement()`](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACHIEVEMENTS/setuserachievement) method.\n\nGet the latest at the top of the [Getting Started](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/step-1-get-the-thing) documentation. If you\'re looking for help interacting with the GameSDK or want to report a bug, join us on the [official Discord](https://discord.gg/discord-developers).\n\n## Changes to Special Channels\n\n#### August 22, 2019\n\nNews Channels are now changed to [Announcement Channels](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_SPECIAL_CHANNELS/announcement-channels). Developer License owners will continue to get access to them (both existing and new). Underlying channel type (GUILD_NEWS = 5) remains the same.\n\n## More Precise Rate Limits\n\n#### August 12, 2019\n\nYou can now get more precise rate limit reset times, via a new request header. Check out the [rate limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/) documentation for more information.\n\n## Bot Tokens for Achievements\n\n#### July 18, 2019\n\nYou can now use Bot tokens for authorization headers against the HTTP API for [Achievements](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACHIEVEMENTS/the-api-way).\n\n## Additional Team Information\n\n#### June 19, 2019\n\nAdditional information around Teams has been added to both the API and the documentation. The [Teams](#DOCS_TOPICS_TEAMS/teams) page now includes information about the team and team member objects. Additionally, the [Get Current Application Information](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/get-current-bot-application-information) endpoint now returns a `team` object if that application belongs to a team. That documentation has also been updated to includes fields that were missing for applications that are games sold on Discord.\n\n## Added Info Around Nitro Boosting Experiment\n\n#### May 29, 2019\n\nAdditional information has been documented to support [Server Nitro Boosting](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting). This includes the addition of a few [message types](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object-message-types), as well as some [new fields on guilds](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object-premium-tier). Please note that this feature is currently under experimentation, and these fields may be subject to change.\n\n## Deprecation of Discord-RPC Rich Presence SDK\n\n#### April 29, 2019\n\nThe [Discord-RPC](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc) implementation of Rich Presence has been deprecated in favor of Discord\'s new GameSDK. If you\'re interested in using Rich Presence, please read our [SDK Starter Guide](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/) and check out the relevant functions in the [Activity Manager](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/).\n\n## New Invite Object Fields\n\n#### April 18, 2019\n\nThe [Invite Object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_INVITE/invite-object) now includes two additional fields, `target_user` and `target_user_type`.\n\n## Ask to Join & Rich Presence SDK\n\n#### January 14, 2019\n\nAsk to Join no longer requires approval or whitelisting to use. You are welcome to create in-game UI, but all Ask to Join requests are also now handled by the Discord overlay.\n\nThere have also been some small additions to the Rich Presence SDK. The previously undocumented `UpdateHandlers()` function is now documented.\n\n## Documentation: Dispatch Store Listings\n\n#### December 11, 2018\n\nDispatch documentation around store listings has been removed. Store pages for the Discord Store are now managed entirely within the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers).\n\n## Enhancement: User Object\n\n#### November 30, 2018\n\nThe [User object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) now includes two new additional fields, `premium_type` and `flags`. These can be used to know the Nitro status of a user, or determine which HypeSquad house a user is in.\n\n## Documentation Fix: List of Open DMS in Certain Payloads\n\n#### June 19, 2018\n\nThe documentation has been updated to correctly note that the `private_channels` field in the [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) should be an empty array, as well as the response from `/users/@me/channels` for a bot user. This change has been in effect for a long time, but the documentation was not updated.\n\n## Deprecation: RPC online member count and members list\n\n#### June 11, 2018\n\nWe released server changes that allow guilds to represent an incomplete state of the member list in our clients, which results in inaccurate member lists and online counts over RPC. These fields are now deprecated and will now return an empty members array and an online count of 0 moving forward.\n\n## Enhancement: New Message Properties\n\n#### February 5, 2018\n\nAdditional `activity` and `application` fields—as well as corresponding object documentation—have been added to the [Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object in support of our newly-released [Spotify integration](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000167212-Discord-Spotify-Connection) and previous Rich Presence enhancements.\n\n## Enhancement: Get Guild Emoji Endpoint\n\n#### January 30, 2018\n\nThe [Get Guild Emoji](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/get-guild-emoji) response now also includes a user object if the emoji was added by a user.\n\n## Deprecation: Accept Invite Endpoint\n\n#### January 23, 2018\n\nThe [Accept Invite](#DOCS_RESOURCES_INVITE/) endpoint is deprecated starting today, and will be discontinued on March 23, 2018. The [Add Guild Member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/add-guild-member) endpoint should be used in its place.\n\n## Semi-Breaking Change: Very Large Bot Sharding\n\n#### January 3, 2018\n\nAdditional sharding requirements and information for bots in over 100,000 guilds has been added. This requires a small change in numbers of shards for affected bots. See the [documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sharding-for-very-large-bots) for more information.\n\n## New Feature: Rich Presence\n\n#### November 9, 2017\n\nRich Presence is now live and available for all developers! Rich Presence allows developers to closely integrate with Discord in a number of new, cool ways like:\n\n- Showing more information about a user\'s current game in their profile\n- Allowing users to post invitations to join their party or spectate their game in chat\n- Displaying "Spectate" and "Ask to Join" buttons on users\' profiles\n\nFor more information, check out our [Rich Presence site](https://discord.com/rich-presence). To get started on development, [read the docs](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_HOW_TO/)!\n\n## Breaking Change: API & Gateway Below v6 Discontinued\n\n#### October 16, 2017\n\n[API](#DOCS_REFERENCE/api-versioning) and [Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways-gateway-versions) versions below v6 are now discontinued after being previously deprecated. Version 6 is now the default API and Gateway version. Attempting to use a version below 6 will result in an error.\n\n## New Feature: Channel Categories\n\n#### September 20, 2017\n\nChanges have been made throughout the documentation to reflect the addition of channel categories to Discord. These includes an additional field—`parent_id`—to the base [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object and a new [channel category example](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-example-channel-category).\n\n## New Feature: Emoji Endpoints\n\n#### September 10, 2017\n\n[Emoji endpoints](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-resource) have been added to the API. Bots can now manage guild emojis to their robo-hearts\' content!\n\n## Breaking Change: Presence Activity Objects\n\n#### August 16, 2017\n\nThe `type` field in the [activity object](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/activity-object) for [Gateway Status Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-presence) and [Presence Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update) payloads is no longer optional when the activity object is not null.\n\n## Breaking Change: Default Channels\n\n#### August 3, 2017\n\nAfter today, we are changing how default channels function. The "default" channel for a given user is now the channel with the highest position that their permissions allow them to see. New guilds will no longer have a default channel with the same id as the guild. Existing guilds will not have their #general channel id changed. It is possible, if permissions are set in such a way, that a user will not have a default channel in a guild.\n\nWe saw a use case in many servers where the previously-default #general channel was being repurposed as an announcement-only, non-writable channel for new members by using bots to clear the entire message history. Now, that channel can simply be deleted and re-created with the desired permissions. This change also allows dynamic default channels for users based on permissions.\n\nWe are also rolling out a change in conjunction that will allow Discord to remember your last-visited channel in a guild across sessions. Newly-joined users will be directed to the guild\'s default channel on first join; existing members will return to whichever channel they last visited.\n\n## New Feature: Audit Logs\n\n#### July 24, 2017\n\nAudit logs are here! Well, they\'ve been here all along, but now we\'ve got [documentation](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/) about them. Check it out, but remember: with great power comes great responsibility.\n\n## Breaking Change: Version 6\n\n#### July 19, 2017\n\n- [Channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) Object\n  - `is_private` removed\n  - [`type`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-channel-types) is now an integer\n  - `recipient` is now `recipients`, an array of [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) objects\n- [Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) Object\n  - [`type`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object-message-types) added to support system messages\n- [Status Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-presence-gateway-presence-update-structure) Object\n  - `idle_since` renamed to `since`\n'

e.exports='# Discord Developer Terms of Service\n\n## Effective date: August 18, 2020 \n\n## Posted date: July 15, 2020\n \n*For a link to the previous terms, please see [here](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/b9edace323c9df64c79f104d85984690ae4e2977/docs/Legal.md).*\n\nWelcome to Discord’s APIs, software development kits (**“SDKs”**), and associated documentation (collectively, **"APIs"**). \n\nThroughout this document, we use the word **_“Terms”_** to refer to the terms below, terms within the accompanying API and SDK documentation, our [Discord Developer Policy](#DOCS_POLICY/), and any applicable policies and guidelines. If there is a conflict between these terms and additional terms applicable to a given API, the additional terms will control for that conflict. \n\n# Section 1: Acceptance of the Terms and Registration\n\n## a. Accepting the Terms\n\nBy accessing or using our APIs you are agreeing to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. You are also agreeing that (i) you are 13 years of age and the minimum age of digital consent in your country, (ii) if you are the age of majority in your jurisdiction or over, that you have read, understood, and accept to be bound by the Terms, and (iii) if you are between 13 (or the minimum age of digital consent, as applicable) and the age of majority in your jurisdiction, that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these Terms. Please read all the Terms carefully. \n\nYou may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if you are a person barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the APIs.\n\nIf you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to "you" in the Terms refer to that entity).\n\n## b. Registration\n\nIn order to access certain APIs you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the APIs, or as part of your continued use of the APIs. You must provide accurate and up-to-date registration information at all times. We will use the information you submit in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).\n\n# Section 2: User Privacy and Security.\n\n## a. Implement Good Privacy Practices.\n\nYou will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to personally identifiable information ("PII"). You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your application that uses the API (your “API Client”) that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information with Discord and third parties.\n\n## b. Implement Good Security. \n\nYou will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect data collected by your API Client, including PII, from unauthorized access or use. These efforts will include, but are not limited to, encryption of this data at rest. You will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.\n\n# Section 3: API Clients and Monitoring\n\nThe APIs are designed to help you enhance your API Client. You agree to respond promptly to our requests to verify and audit your compliance with these Terms. YOU AGREE THAT DISCORD MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE DISCORD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. This monitoring may include Discord accessing and using your API Client, for example to identify security issues that could affect Discord or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Discord may use any technical means to overcome such interference. \n\n# Section 4: IP, DMCA, and Confidentiality\n\n## a. IP Ownership, Open Source, and Feedback \n\nDiscord does not acquire ownership in your API Clients, and by using our APIs, you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs or the content that is accessed through our APIs.\n\nSome of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license. Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements. For certain APIs, open source software is listed in the documentation. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with Discord for the applicable open source software.\n\nIf you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we (and those we allow) may use such information without obligation to you.\n\n## b. Discord DMCA Policy\n\nWe can\'t determine whether something is being used legally or not without copyright holder’s input. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Discord\'s policy about responding to notices in our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).\n\n## c. Confidential Matters\n\n1. Developer credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client secrets) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.\n2. Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Discord confidential information. Discord confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you will not disclose it to any third party without Discord\'s prior written consent unless required by law with reasonable prior notice to us (unless a court orders that we not receive notice).\n\n# Section 5: Content\n\n## a. Content Accessible Through our APIs\n\nOur APIs contain some third-party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available and you are solely responsible for your decision to use or distribute any of this content. While we may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms, and we may remove or refuse to display content, we make no representations or warranties about the content, its appropriateness, legality, pedigree or other details. Finally, content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the API may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy.\n\n## b. Submission of Content\n\nSome of our APIs allow the submission of content. Discord does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client, except as expressly provided in these Terms. For the sole purpose of enabling Discord to provide, secure, and improve the APIs (and the related service(s)) and only in accordance with the applicable Discord privacy policies, you give Discord a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to Use content submitted, posted, or displayed to or from the APIs through your API Client. **_"Use"_** means use, host, store, modify, communicate, and publish. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, you will ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license.\n\n# Section 6: Brand Features; Attribution\n\n## a. Brand Features\n\n**_"Brand Features"_** is defined as the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features of each party. Except where expressly stated, the Terms do not grant either party any right, title, or interest in or to the other party\'s Brand Features. All use by you of Discord’s Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to the benefit of Discord. All use by us of your Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to your benefit.\n \n## b. Attribution\n\nYou agree to display any attribution(s) required by Discord as described in the documentation for the API. Discord hereby grants to you a nontransferable, nonsublicenseable, nonexclusive license while the Terms are in effect to display Discord’s Brand Features for the purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the APIs. You must only use the Discord Brand Features in accordance with the Terms and for the purpose of fulfilling your obligations under this Section. In using Discord’s Brand Features, you must follow the [Discord Brand Features Use Guidelines](https://discord.com/branding). You understand and agree that Discord has the sole discretion to determine whether your attribution(s) and use of Discord\'s Brand Features are in accordance with the above requirements and guidelines.\n\n## c. Publicity\n\nYou will not make any statement regarding your use of an API which suggests partnership with, sponsorship by, or endorsement by Discord without a Discord officer’s prior written approval.\n\n## d. Promotional and Marketing Use\n\nIn the course of promoting, marketing, or demonstrating the APIs you are using and the associated Discord products, Discord may produce and distribute incidental depictions, including screenshots, video, or other content from your API Client, and may use your company or product name. You grant us all necessary rights for the above purposes.\n\n# Section 7: Termination\n\n## a. Termination\n\nYou may stop using our APIs at any time with or without notice. Discord reserves the right to terminate the Terms with you or discontinue the APIs or any portion or feature or your access thereto if you violate any of these Terms, if we believe your Application harms us or our users, or at our convenience upon notice to you. \n\n## b. Your Obligations Post-Termination\n\nUpon any termination of the Terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API, cease all use of the Discord Brand Features, and delete any cached or stored data collected by your API Client. Discord may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with your API Client and developer credentials to provide notice of the termination of your right to use an API.\n\n## c. Surviving Provisions\n\nWhen the Terms come to an end, those terms that by their nature are intended to continue indefinitely will continue to apply, including but not limited to: Sections 4b, 5, 7, 8, and 9.\n\n# Section 8: Liability for our APIs\n\n## a. WARRANTIES\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THE TERMS, NEITHER DISCORD NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE APIS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON\'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT ACCESSED OR MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE APIS, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE APIS, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE APIs "AS IS".\n\nSOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE TERMS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERTAKINGS.\n\n## b. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\nWHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCORD, AND DISCORD’S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA; FINANCIAL LOSSES; OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\nTO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF DISCORD, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APPLICABLE APIS (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE APIS AGAIN) DURING THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.\n\nIN ALL CASES, DISCORD, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXPENSE, LOSS, OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.\n\n## c. Indemnification\n\nUnless prohibited by applicable law, you will defend and indemnify Discord, and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and users, against all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, fees (including legal fees), and expenses relating to any allegation or third-party legal proceeding to the extent arising from:\n\n1. your actual or alleged misuse or your end users’ misuse of the APIs;\n2. your actual or alleged violation or your end users’ violation of the Terms; \n3. your actual or alleged infringement of any third party’s intellectual property rights or rights to privacy or publicity; or\n4. any content or data routed into or used with the APIs by you, those acting on your behalf, or your end users.\n\n# Section 9: General Provisions\n\n## a. Modification\n\nWe may change these Terms from time to time. If we make a material change to the Terms, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the change taking effect at the email address or Discord ID we have on file for you. You can review the most current version of these Terms at any time by visiting this page. The materially revised Terms will become effective on the date set forth in our notice, and all other changes will become effective upon posting of the change.  Also, changes addressing new functions for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms for an API, you should discontinue your use of that API. Your continued use of the API constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.\n\n## b. U.S. Federal Agency Entities\n\nThe APIs were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency supplements thereto.\n\n## c. Choice of Law; Dispute Resolution\n\nExcept as set forth below the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California\'s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to the Terms or the APIs.\n\nThis Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and enforced in all respects in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to its principles of conflicts of law. If you have a dispute with Discord arising out of or in connection with the subject matter covered by these Terms, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If we aren’t able to resolve the dispute informally, you and we each agree that any claim or dispute between you and the Company that arises in whole or in part from these Terms or your use of the API shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco County, California, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of San Francisco County, California.\n\nIf you are accepting the Terms on behalf of a United States city, county, or state government entity, then the following applies instead of the paragraph above: the parties agree to remain silent regarding governing law and venue.\n\n## d. General Legal Terms\n\nWe each agree to contract in the English language. If we provide a translation of the Terms, we do so for your convenience only and the English Terms will solely govern our relationship. The Terms do not create any third party beneficiary rights or any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Nothing in the Terms will limit either party\'s ability to seek injunctive relief. We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and Discord does not take action right away, this does not mean that Discord is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and Discord relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject. For information about how to contact Discord, please visit our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).\n\nYou may not assign, sublicense or delegate any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to any third party without the prior written consent of Discord. Any assignment, sublicense or delegation in violation of this provision is null and void. Any change of control or material ownership of you is hereby deemed an assignment. \nThese Terms are non-exclusive. You acknowledge that Discord may develop products or services that may compete with the API Clients or any other products or services.\n\n**_"Discord"_** means Discord Inc., with offices in San Francisco, California  unless set forth otherwise in additional terms applicable for a given API. We may refer to "Discord" as "we", "our", or "us" in the Terms.\n \n \n'

e.exports='# Discord Developer Policy\n\n## Last updated: July 1, 2020\n\nThis Discord Developer Policy is incorporated into the Discord Developer Terms of Service (“Terms”) and applies to all uses of our APIs.

e.exports='# API Reference\n\nDiscord\'s API is based around two core layers, a HTTPS/REST API for general operations, and persistent secure WebSocket based connection for sending and subscribing to real-time events. The most common use case of the Discord API will be providing a service, or access to a platform through the [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) API.\n\n###### Base URL\n\n```\nhttps://discord.com/api\n```\n\n## API Versioning\n\n> danger\n> Some API and Gateway versions are now non-functioning, and are labeled as discontinued in the table below for posterity. Trying to use these versions will fail and return 400 Bad Request.\n\nDiscord exposes different versions of our API. You can specify which version to use by including it in the request path like `https://discord.com/api/v{version_number}`. Omitting the version number from the route will route requests to the current default version (marked below accordingly). You can find the change log for the newest API version [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/change-log).\n\n###### API Versions\n\n| Version | Status                           | Default |\n|---------|----------------------------------|---------|\n| 9       | Available                        |         |\n| 8       | Available                        |         |\n| 7       | Doesn\'t look like anything to me |         |\n| 6       | Deprecated                       | ✓       |\n| 5       | Discontinued                     |         |\n| 4       | Discontinued                     |         |\n| 3       | Discontinued                     |         |\n\n## Error Messages\n\nIn API v8, we\'ve improved error formatting in form error responses. The response will tell you which json key contains the error, the error code, and a human readable error message. We will be frequently adding new error messages, so a complete list of errors is not feasible and would be almost instantly out of date. Here are some examples instead:\n\n###### Array Error\n\n```json\n{\n    "code": 50035,\n    "errors": {\n        "activities": {\n            "0": {\n                "platform": {\n                    "_errors": [\n                        {\n                            "code": "BASE_TYPE_CHOICES",\n                            "message": "Value must be one of (\'desktop\', \'android\', \'ios\')."\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                "type": {\n                    "_errors": [\n                        {\n                            "code": "BASE_TYPE_CHOICES",\n                            "message": "Value must be one of (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)."\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    "message": "Invalid Form Body"\n}\n```\n\n###### Object Error\n\n```json\n{\n    "code": 50035,\n    "errors": {\n        "access_token": {\n            "_errors": [\n                {\n                    "code": "BASE_TYPE_REQUIRED",\n                    "message": "This field is required"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    "message": "Invalid Form Body"\n}\n```\n\n###### Request Error\n\n```json\n{\n    "code": 50035,\n    "message": "Invalid Form Body",\n    "errors": {\n        "_errors": [\n            {\n                "code": "APPLICATION_COMMAND_TOO_LARGE",\n                "message": "Command exceeds maximum size (4000)"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthenticating with the Discord API can be done in one of two ways:\n\n1. Using a bot token gained by [registering a bot](#APPLICATIONS), for more information on bots see [bots vs user accounts](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/bot-vs-user-accounts).\n2. Using an OAuth2 bearer token gained through the [OAuth2 API](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/oauth2).\n\nFor all authentication types, authentication is performed with the `Authorization` HTTP header in the format `Authorization: TOKEN_TYPE TOKEN`.\n\n###### Example Bot Token Authorization Header\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bot MTk4NjIyNDgzNDcxOTI1MjQ4.Cl2FMQ.ZnCjm1XVW7vRze4b7Cq4se7kKWs\n```\n\n###### Example Bearer Token Authorization Header\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer CZhtkLDpNYXgPH9Ml6shqh2OwykChw\n```\n\n## Encryption\n\nAll HTTP-layer services and protocols (e.g. HTTP, WebSocket) within the Discord API are using TLS 1.2.\n\n## Snowflakes\n\nDiscord utilizes Twitter\'s [snowflake](https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/tree/snowflake-2010) format for uniquely identifiable descriptors (IDs). These IDs are guaranteed to be unique across all of Discord, except in some unique scenarios in which child objects share their parent\'s ID. Because Snowflake IDs are up to 64 bits in size (e.g. a uint64), they are always returned as strings in the HTTP API to prevent integer overflows in some languages. See [Gateway ETF/JSON](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/etfjson) for more information regarding Gateway encoding.\n\n###### Snowflake ID Broken Down in Binary\n\n```\n111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 11111 11111 111111111111\n64                                         22    17    12          0\n```\n\n###### Snowflake ID Format Structure (Left to Right)\n\n| Field               | Bits     | Number of bits | Description                                                                  | Retrieval                           |\n|---------------------|----------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Timestamp           | 63 to 22 | 42 bits        | Milliseconds since Discord Epoch, the first second of 2015 or 1420070400000. | `(snowflake >> 22) + 1420070400000` |\n| Internal worker ID  | 21 to 17 | 5 bits         |                                                                              | `(snowflake & 0x3E0000) >> 17`      |\n| Internal process ID | 16 to 12 | 5 bits         |                                                                              | `(snowflake & 0x1F000) >> 12`       |\n| Increment           | 11 to 0  | 12 bits        | For every ID that is generated on that process, this number is incremented   | `snowflake & 0xFFF`                 |\n\n### Convert Snowflake to DateTime\n\n![Graphical representation of how a Snowflake is constructed](snowflake.png)\n\n### Snowflake IDs in Pagination\n\nWe typically use snowflake IDs in many of our API routes for pagination. The standardized pagination paradigm we utilize is one in which you can specify IDs `before` and `after` in combination with `limit` to retrieve a desired page of results. You will want to refer to the specific endpoint documentation for details.\n\nIt is useful to note that snowflake IDs are just numbers with a timestamp, so when dealing with pagination where you want results from the beginning of time (in Discord Epoch, but `0` works here too) or before/after a specific time you can generate a snowflake ID for that time.\n\n###### Generating a snowflake ID from a Timestamp Example\n\n```\n(timestamp_ms - DISCORD_EPOCH) << 22\n```\n\n## ID Serialization\n\nThere are some cases in which our API and Gateway may return IDs in an unexpected format. Internally, Discord stores IDs as integer snowflakes. When we serialize IDs to JSON, we transform `bigints` into strings. Given that all Discord IDs are snowflakes, you should always expect a string.\n\nHowever, there are cases in which passing something to our API will instead return IDs serialized as an integer; this is the case when you send our API or Gateway a value in an `id` field that is not `bigint` size. For example, when requesting `GUILD_MEMBERS_CHUNK` from our gateway:\n\n```\n// Send\n{\n  op: 8,\n  d: {\n    guild_id: \'308994132968210433\',\n    user_ids: [ \'123123\' ]\n  }\n}\n\n// Receive\n{\n  t: \'GUILD_MEMBERS_CHUNK\',\n  s: 3,\n  op: 0,\n  d: {\n    not_found: [ 123123 ],\n    members: [],\n    guild_id: \'308994132968210433\'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can see in this case that the sent `user_id` is not a `bigint`; therefore, when it is serialized back to JSON by Discord, it is not transformed into a string. **This will never happen with IDs that come from Discord.** But, this can happen if you send malformed data in your requests.\n\n## ISO8601 Date/Time\n\nDiscord utilizes the [ISO8601 format](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0038_iso_wd_8601-1_2016-02-16.pdf) for most Date/Times returned in our models. This format is referred to as type `ISO8601` within tables in this documentation.\n\n## Nullable and Optional Resource Fields\n\nResource fields that may contain a `null` value have types that are prefixed with a question mark.\nResource fields that are optional have names that are suffixed with a question mark.\n\n###### Example Nullable and Optional Fields\n\n| Field                        | Type    |\n|------------------------------|---------|\n| optional_field?              | string  |\n| nullable_field               | ?string |\n| optional_and_nullable_field? | ?string |\n\n## Consistency\n\nDiscord operates at a scale where true consistency is impossible. Because of this, lots of operations in our API and in-between our services are [eventually consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency). Due to this, client actions can never be serialized and may be executed in _any_ order (if executed at all). Along with these constraints, events in Discord may:\n\n- Never be sent to a client\n- Be sent _exactly_ one time to the client\n- Be sent up to N times per client\n\nClients should operate on events and results from the API in as much of an idempotent behavior as possible.\n\n## HTTP API\n\n### User Agent\n\nClients using the HTTP API must provide a valid [User Agent](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.43) which specifies information about the client library and version in the following format:\n\n###### User Agent Example\n\n```\nUser-Agent: DiscordBot ($url, $versionNumber)\n```\n\nClients may append more information and metadata to the _end_ of this string as they wish.\n\n### Rate Limiting\n\nThe HTTP API implements a process for limiting and preventing excessive requests in accordance with [RFC 6585](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4). API users that regularly hit and ignore rate limits will have their API keys revoked, and be blocked from the platform. For more information on rate limiting of requests, please see the [Rate Limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/rate-limits) section.\n\n### Boolean Query Strings\n\nCertain endpoints in the API are documented to accept booleans for their query string parameters. While there is no standard system for boolean representation in query string parameters, Discord represents such cases using `True`, `true`, or `1` for true and `False`, `false` or `0` for false.\n\n## Gateway (WebSocket) API\n\nDiscord\'s Gateway API is used for maintaining persistent, stateful websocket connections between your client and our servers. These connections are used for sending and receiving real-time events your client can use to track and update local state. The Gateway API uses secure websocket connections as specified in [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455). For information on opening Gateway connections, please see the [Gateway API](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways) section.\n\n## Message Formatting\n\nDiscord utilizes a subset of markdown for rendering message content on its clients, while also adding some custom functionality to enable things like mentioning users and channels. This functionality uses the following formats:\n\n###### Formats\n\n| Type                    | Structure           | Example                      |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| User                    | <@USER_ID>          | <@80351110224678912>         |\n| User (Nickname)         | <@!USER_ID>         | <@!80351110224678912>        |\n| Channel                 | <#CHANNEL_ID>       | <#103735883630395392>        |\n| Role                    | <@&ROLE_ID>         | <@&165511591545143296>       |\n| Standard Emoji          | Unicode Characters  | 💯                           |\n| Custom Emoji            | <:NAME:ID>          | <:mmLol:216154654256398347>  |\n| Custom Emoji (Animated) | <a:NAME:ID>         | <a:b1nzy:392938283556143104> |\n| Unix Timestamp          | <t:TIMESTAMP>       | <t:1618953630>               |\n| Unix Timestamp (Styled) | <t:TIMESTAMP:STYLE> | <t:1618953630:d>             |\n\nUsing the markdown for either users, roles, or channels will usually mention the target(s) accordingly, but this can be suppressed using the `allowed_mentions` parameter when creating a message. Standard emoji are currently rendered using [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) for Desktop/Android and Apple\'s native emoji on iOS.\n\nTimestamps will display the given timestamp in the user\'s timezone and locale.\n\n###### Timestamp Styles\n\n| Style | Example Output               | Description     |\n| ----- | ---------------------------- | --------------- |\n| t     | 16:20                        | Short Time      |\n| T     | 16:20:30                     | Long Time       |\n| d     | 20/04/2021                   | Short Date      |\n| D     | 20 April 2021                | Long Date       |\n| f \\*  | 20 April 2021 16:20          | Short Date/Time |\n| F     | Tuesday, 20 April 2021 16:20 | Long Date/Time  |\n| R     | 2 months ago                 | Relative Time   |\n\n\\*default\n\n## Image Formatting\n\n###### Image Base Url\n\n```\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/\n```\n\nDiscord uses ids and hashes to render images in the client. These hashes can be retrieved through various API requests, like [Get User](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-user). Below are the formats, size limitations, and CDN endpoints for images in Discord. The returned format can be changed by changing the [extension name](#DOCS_REFERENCE/image-formatting-image-formats) at the end of the URL. The returned size can be changed by appending a querystring of `?size=desired_size` to the URL. Image size can be any power of two between 16 and 4096.\n\n###### Image Formats\n\n| Name   | Extension   |\n|--------|-------------|\n| JPEG   | .jpg, .jpeg |\n| PNG    | .png        |\n| WebP   |

For completeness' sake, (i) Discord Store Account Owners located in the United States will enter into a license agreement for Apps with Developer (effectuated by Discord in the name of and on behalf of Developer), and (ii) Discord Store Account Owners located in the rest of the world will enter into a license agreement for Apps with Discord (but for the risk and account of Developer).\n\n2.3 **Marketing License.** Developer hereby grants to Discord a royalty-free license, during the Term, to copy, perform, display, create derivative works of, use, and distribute (a) the Developer Marks and (b) materials from the Apps (for example, screenshots), marketing material (for example, videos), and ratings information in connection with the promotion, marketing, licensing, sale, and distribution of the Apps and the exercise of Discord’s other rights under this Agreement.

App Submissions\n\n3.1 **Submission.** Developer shall submit each App (or Localized Version) to Discord for distribution via the Discord Store concurrently with the first commercial release of each App (or Localized Version), or, if already commercially released as of the Effective Date, within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date. Developer shall also submit to Discord any Localized Versions when generally available, but in no event later than they are provided to any other third party for commercial release. All submissions must be in object code form, and in the format reasonably requested by Discord. Developer will ensure that any password needed to access its Discord Store account is treated as Confidential Information, and agrees that it will be responsible for any use of that password, whether by Developer or any third party.\n\n3.2 **Testing.** Before submitting any software to Discord, Developer shall perform quality assurance and other error and bug testing of the Apps (including any Localized Versions and all App Updates), in a professional manner consistent with industry standards. Discord may also conduct hardware and software compatibility and performance testing on the Apps, either itself or via a third party.\n\n3.3 **Compatibility.** Developer shall make the Apps compatible with Discord Store services that Developer may choose to use. Developer shall use reasonable efforts to maintain compatibility of the Apps with future versions of Discord Store.\n\n3.4 **App-Related Content.** If Developer distributes an App and App-Related Content for that App via any channel other than Discord Store, Developer will deliver the App-Related Content to Discord simultaneously to enable Discord to make such App-Related Content available to Discord Store Account Owners. In addition, to the extent any App supports the sale of digital items or digital currency for use in the App, Developer shall not allow or facilitate the redemption or exchange of such digital items or digital currency for real-world currency.\n\n3.5 **No Links to Other Stores.** Developer will ensure that Apps distributed via Discord Store will not include functionality from or links or references to any store other than Discord Store, or any other payment or purchase facility.\n\n3.6 **User Reviews.** Discord may, in its discretion, make available a user review system for Apps. Developer shall not manipulate the user review system for Apps, including but not limited to soliciting positive reviews in exchange for value.\n\n3.7 **Ratings Information.** Discord will facilitate Developer’s inclusion of Ratings Information for Apps in the Discord Store. Developer agrees to provide via the Discord Store current and accurate Ratings Information for each App.\n\n3.8 **Privacy and App Sales Data.** Subject to Discord’s privacy policy, the current version of which is located at discord.com/privacy, (the “Discord Privacy Policy”) the Discord Store Subscriber Agreement, applicable laws and any other obligations Discord has to a third party or otherwise, Discord will provide Developer with Sales Data for the Apps. The Discord Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into this Agreement.\n\n### 4\\. Marketing and Publicity\n\n4.1 **Marketing.** Discord may, at its own expense and sole discretion, market and promote the Apps via Discord Store and other channels, including but not limited to the Discord and Discord Store web sites and shall include the right to distribute promotional copies of the App(s).\n\n4.2 **Press Releases and Press Accounts.** Discord and Developer may reference in public statements the fact that the Apps are or will be available on Discord Store; however, any press release about the other Party shall be subject to the prior approval of the other Party. Discord may make the Apps available to journalists via press subscription accounts free-of- charge in order to enable such journalists to evaluate and review the Apps.\n\n4.3 **Demo Versions.** If Developer releases a Demo Version outside of the Discord Store that includes a reference regarding the method(s) to purchase the App, Developer shall cooperate with Discord to include a reference to Discord Store in that version.\n\n### 5\\. Support\n\n5.1 **Developer Support to Discord.** Developer shall with respect to each App: (a) correct within a reasonable period of time all material bugs, errors, or defects in the Apps (collectively, “Errors”) of which Discord informs Developer; (b) deliver all App Updates when made available to any other third party; (c) provide such other reasonable additional support as Discord may reasonably request. If, in Discord's sole judgment, an App contains Errors or is otherwise of insufficient quality to meet Discord’s standards, it may suspend the availability of such App in the Discord Store.  In the event Discord has suspended the availability of all Apps under this Agreement, it may terminate this Agreement for convenience. In addition, Developer must implement the Discord Store SDK in a manner that is safe and secure for the Discord Store Account Owner.  Discord may, but shall not be obligated to, correct any security vulnerabilities in Developer’s implementation of the Discord Store SDK and Developer shall provide assistance with such corrections as requested by Discord.  If Discord cannot reasonably correct any such vulnerabilities, or Discord determines that Developer should correct them, Developer shall correct such vulnerabilities.\n\n5.2 **Developer Support to End Users.** Developer will provide support to Discord Store Account Owners who have acquired a copy of the Apps, at the same level that Developer provides customer support for such applications made available directly or via other channels. Such support shall include but not be limited to responding to questions and assisting customers in the diagnosis and correction of issues encountered in using the Apps.\n\n5.3 **Discord End User Support.** Provided that Developer has complied with its support obligations in this Section 5, Discord will provide a reasonable level of support for issues related to Discord Store reported by Discord Store Account Owners.\n\n### 6\\. Revenue, Reporting, and Payments\n\n6.1 **Licensee Fees or Other Fees.** Within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month, Discord will provide to Developer a report of Gross Revenue and Net Revenue for such month (each a “Monthly Report”). Each Monthly Report will contain activity for the current month as well as any Net Revenue adjustments for prior months reported by payment processors in the current month. Unless mutually agreed by Discord and Developer in a separate written agreement executed by both parties, Discord will pay to Developer ninety percent (90%) of the Net Revenue on the Monthly Report (the “License Fees”) within thirty (30) days after the Monthly Report is published, in no event later than sixty (60) days from the end of the of the calendar month covered by the Monthly Report. For completeness' sake, the remaining ten percent (10%) of the Net Revenue retained by Discord shall be payment of the consideration by Developer to Discord for the services and activities performed by Discord under this Agreement. Developer acknowledges and agrees that Discord, in the course of acting as agent or commissionaire of Developer, is hosting the Apps, and is allowing the download of those Apps by Discord Store Account Owners, on behalf of or respectively for the risk and account of Developer. All of the Apps and App-Related Content shall be marketed by Discord, on behalf of Developer, to Discord Store Account Owners at the prices established by Developer. Developer may change the price for any Apps or App-Related Content at any time, at Developer’s discretion, upon notice to Discord. As agent or commissionaire for Developer, Discord shall be solely responsible for the collection of all prices payable by Discord Store Account Owners for Apps acquired by those Discord Store Account Owners.\n\n6.2 **Taxes.** In the event that any remittance made by Discord to Developer is subject to any VAT, the full amount of such VAT shall be solely for the account of Developer, and will not reduce Discord's fee amount to which Discord is entitled on such transaction. To the extent required under applicable law, Discord will deduct the full amount of such VAT from the amount owed to Developer, and will pay the full amount withheld to the competent tax authorities. Discord will use commercially reasonably efforts to obtain, and to furnish to Developer, copies of official tax receipts or similar evidence of payment, confirming payment of such VAT to the competent tax authorities. Developer will indemnify and hold Discord harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authorities for any underpayment of any VAT, and any penalties and/or interest thereon, including, but not limited to, underpayments attributable to any erroneous claim or representation by Developer as to its entitlement to, or any disqualification of Developer for, the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding tax..\n\n6.3 **Minimum Monthly Payment and Negative Amounts.** In the event amounts due to Developer for a given month do not exceed one hundred U.S. dollars ($100), Discord may elect to not remit payment for that month, and may instead accumulate payments due until they exceed one hundred U.S. dollars ($100) as of the end of a future monthly payment cycle. Also, to the extent that the payment calculation in a Monthly Report results in a negative amount, that negative amount will be carried forward and deducted from any future amounts otherwise payable to Developer by Discord under this Agreement.\n\n6.4 **Multi-Platform Apps.** To the extent that Developer has submitted to Discord Store versions of an App for multiple operating systems (for example, a Mac version, and a Windows version) such versions shall be sold together as a single \"hybrid\" App unit on Discord Store. Accordingly, a Mac version of any App, a Windows version of an App, and a Linux version of an App shall not be considered separate sales when calculating the payments due to Developer hereunder.\n\n### 7\\. Term\n\n7.1 **Term.** The term of this Agreement (“Term”) shall begin on the Effective Date and continue until the end of the latest App Term for any App unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n7.2 **App Term.** With respect to each App, the App Term shall commence on the GA Date for such App and continue for one (1) year (the “Initial App Term”); and shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods (\"Renewal Term\") until terminated by either party pursuant to Section 7.3 or Section 7.4 below.\n\n7.3 **Termination for Cause.** Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice at any time if the other party is in breach of this Agreement and has failed to cure that breach within thirty (30) days after written notice of that breach. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party (a) becomes insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (b) files a petition, or has a third party file a petition with respect to it, under any bankruptcy or similar statute; or (c) materially breaches this Agreement and such breach is not capable of cure.\n\n7.4 **Termination for Convenience.** Either party may terminate this Agreement for convenience (with or without cause), during any Renewal Term, by providing the other party with thirty (30) days prior written notice of such termination, provided that during such period the parties have reasonably discussed and agreed on a process for sunsetting the Apps (a “Sunset Process”). In the event that a Sunset Process has not been agreed upon within such 30-day period, or the Sunset Process requires that this Agreement remain fully in force for longer than such 30-day period, this Agreement will not terminate until the completion of the Sunset Process.. In addition, Discord may terminate this Agreement immediately at any time upon written notice to Developer in the event that Discord (a) determines in its discretion that any or all Apps are not suitable for distribution via the Discord Store or (b) ceases to operate the Discord Store or the self-service portion of the Discord Store.\n\n7.5 **Survival.** Sections 2.5, 2.6, 3.1 - 3.7, 5.2 (only with respect to supporting Discord Store Account Owners that have licensed an App prior to termination or expiration), 6 (only with respect to amounts that accrued prior to termination or expiration), 7.5, and 8 - 13, and any then-existing Discord Store Account Owner licenses to Apps, shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n### 8\\. Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n8.1 **Mutual Representations and Warranties.** Each party represents and warrants that (a) this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by such party; (b) it has all necessary power and authority to execute and perform its obligations under this Agreement; and (c) its execution and performance of this Agreement will not violate any applicable law or regulation or violate any rights of, or breach any obligation owed to, a third party.\n\n8.2 **Developer Representations and Warranties.** Developer represents and warrants that (a) it originally created the Apps (which, for purposes of this Section 8.2, include Demo Versions, Localized Versions and App Updates) and the Developer Marks, or otherwise has the rights necessary to grant the licenses and to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement; (b) the Apps will conform to any documentation for the Apps; (c) the Apps and the Developer Marks do not infringe any right of any third party, including but not limited to any intellectual property right or right of publicity or privacy; (d) the Apps do not violate any terms of the Discord Store Subscriber Agreement; (e) it is in compliance with and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and its privacy policy, in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to its use of any end user data supplied by Discord to Developer under this Agreement; (f) it has all necessary rights to any content or information it submits to Discord through the Discord Store partner portal or using any Discord Store-provided partner or publishing tools; and (g) the Apps do not contain any software viruses, trojan horses, or any other harmful or malicious code. Developer further represents and warrants that neither it nor its agents are on any list maintained by the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of persons, entities, or prohibited or restricted jurisdictions (“Restricted List”) and Developer shall promptly notify Discord in writing if it is no longer in compliance with, or is likely to become noncompliant with, the foregoing representation or warranty. In such event, or if Developer or any of its agents are on any OFAC Restricted List, Discord, in addition to any other remedies, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately without providing Developer an opportunity to cure.\n\n8.3 **Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ALL MATERIAL PROVIDED BY SUCH PARTY HEREUNDER IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION.**\n\n### 9\\. Indemnification\n\nDeveloper will indemnify, defend (upon Discord’s written request), and hold harmless Discord and its Affiliates, successors, officers, directors and employees from any loss, liability, expense or damage (including attorneys’ fees) (“Liabilities”) arising out of any third party action, cause of action, claim or demand (each, a “Claim”) alleging a breach by Developer of its representations and warranties under Section 8 of this Agreement. Discord will promptly notify Developer of a Claim, provided that any delay in providing such notice shall relieve Developer of its obligations only to the extent that such delay materially prejudiced Developer. If Discord requests Developer to defend a Claim, Discord shall give Developer sole control of the defense of the Claim, provided that Developer shall not settle or otherwise dispose of any Claim in any manner that imposes fault or other liability on Discord. Discord may, at its own expense, participate in any such defense with its own counsel.\n\n### 10\\. Limitation of Liability\n\nEXCEPT FOR BREACH OF SECTION 12 (CONFIDENTIALITY), IN NO EVENT SHALL DISCORD BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR (B) ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF (IN THE AGGREGATE) THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PROVISION HEREIN, REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY UPON WHICH ANY CLAIM FOR SUCH DAMAGES IS BASED. THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\n### 11\\. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue\n\nThis Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without reference to conflicts of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between the parties that arises in whole or in part from this Agreement or Developer’s use of the Discord Store shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, California. Developer hereby consents to, and waives all defenses with respect to, venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of Santa Clara County, California.\n\n### 12\\. Confidentiality\n\n12.1 \"**Confidential Information**\" means all non-public information that is identified as being confidential or which should reasonably be understood to be confidential, which includes without limitation, information relating to released or unreleased products, marketing or promotion of any product, financial information, business policies or practices, personnel, pricing and sales information, technology, computer programs, unpublished works of original authorship, trade secrets, or information received from third parties that the disclosing party is obligated to treat as confidential. Without limiting the foregoing, the terms of this Agreement and Sales Data shall be Discord’s Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally known or available by publication, commercial use or otherwise through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) is known by the receiving party without restriction at the time of disclosure; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party without the use of any Confidential Information received from the disclosing party; or (iv) is lawfully obtained without restriction from a third party that has the right to make such disclosure.\n\n12.2 The receiving party shall use Confidential Information it receives solely in connection with its performance under this Agreement, and shall disclose such Confidential Information only to employees and contractors who have a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement and are bound by written confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those herein. The receiving party shall protect Confidential Information from unauthorized disclosure and use with the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event less than reasonable care.\n\n12.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as necessary to comply with any court order or applicable law or regulation, provided that such party to the extent reasonably possible gives prior written notice to the other party of the possibility of such disclosure and to resist or limit disclosure, including without limitation reasonably cooperating with the other party in seeking a protective order or other similar relief.\n\n12.4 After termination of this Agreement or receiving earlier written request from the other party, the receiving party shall promptly return or delete the Confidential Information received from the disclosing party.\n\n### 13\\. General Provisions\n\n13.1 **Independent Contractor.** The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. This Agreement does not create any joint venture, partnership, or other business entity.\n\n13.2 **Notices.** Any notices required by this Agreement must be sent in writing via overnight delivery by a nationally recognized courier service (e.g., FedEx) or first-class mail, signature required and shall be deemed effective upon signature acknowledging receipt by the party receiving notice. All such notices must be addressed to the receiving party at the address stated at the top of this Agreement with attention to the individual executing this Agreement on behalf of such party.\n\n13.3 **Assignment.** Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or its rights hereunder without the other party’s prior written consent, except that such consent shall not be required for (a) a party to transfer this Agreement to an Affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or other corporate combination, or the sale of all or substantially all of such party’s assets, provided that the successor party is not a competitor of the non-transferring party and the transferring party provides prompt notice of such transfer; or (b) Discord to assign, or sublicense some or all of, its rights under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates or to a subcontractor. Such transfer or assignment shall not relieve the transferring or assigning party of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted transfer or assignment by either party in violation of this Section shall be void and of no effect and will constitute a breach by the party attempting such transfer or assignment. This Agreement will be binding upon any permitted successor.\n\n13.4 **Headings.** The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.\n\n13.5 **Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n13.6 **No Waiver.** The failure of a party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision, and no waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.\n\n13.7 **Modifications.** This Agreement may not be modified except by a written agreement dated signed on behalf of Discord and Developer by their respective duly authorized representatives.\n\n13.8 **Complete Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous communications and agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. Neither party has relied in entering into this Agreement on any statement, inducement or representation that is not set forth in this Agreement.

e.exports='# Branches and Builds\n\n> info\n> Need help with Dispatch? Talk to us in the [Discord Developers Server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers)!\n\nIn order for other people to download your game from Discord\'s servers, you need to _upload_ your game to Discord\'s servers. Let\'s learn how to do that!\n\n## Getting Set Up\n\nFirst, get Dispatch for your operating system.\n\n- [Windows 64](https://dl-dispatch.discordapp.net/download/win64)\n- [Windows 32](https://dl-dispatch.discordapp.net/download/win32)\n- [Mac](https://dl-dispatch.discordapp.net/download/macos)\n- [Linux](https://dl-dispatch.discordapp.net/download/linux)\n\nYou\'ll want to be able to use Dispatch across your projects, so let\'s handle that now by adding it to our PATH.\n\n**MacOS/Linux:**\n\nBust out those \\*nix skills.\n\n- Open your choice of terminal\n- Stick dispatch in a folder that will be added to your PATH. If you don\'t have a good spot for this stuff already, you can `mkdir ~/bin/` and call that Dispatch\'s new home (as well as any other executables you might want to access in the future)\n- In that folder, run `chmod u+x dispatch-macos` so that Dispatch can be used as an executable\n  - Feel free to also rename `dispatch-macos` to just `dispatch` if you don\'t feel like typing so much\n- Add that ~/bin directory to your path in a permanent way. I have `export PATH=$PATH:~/bin` at the bottom of my `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bashrc`\n- Restart your terminal\n- `echo $PATH` and make sure you see the directory in the output\n- Run `dispatch --help` to make sure it works\n\nYou\'re good! You can now call the dispatch command from anywhere!\n\n**Windows**\n\nNot as 1337 as some scripting skillz, but the Windows GUI will do just fine\n\n- Stick `dispatch-x64` or `dispatch-x86`, depending on your OS, in a folder that will be added to your PATH\n  - Feel free to rename it to just `dispatch` if you don\'t feel like typing so much\n- Hit that Windows key and start typing "Environment Variables"\n- Select "Edit the system environment variables"\n- Hit the "Environment Variables" button in the bottom right\n- Edit the PATH entry for either the system or the current user, adding dispatch\'s directory\n- Restart your command line\n- Run `dispatch --help` to make sure it works\n\nYou\'re good! You can now call the dispatch command from anywhere!\n\n> info\n> Want some really fancy skills? You can set up autocompletions for dispatch in whatever shell you work.\n> Run `dispatch completions -—help` to see instructions for a variety of popular shells.\n\n## Authorizing Yourself to Use It\n\nRun `dispatch login`, which will open a web browser and prompt you to authorize your Discord account with Dispatch.\n\nYup, that\'s it.\n\nSmall thing to note - the default `login` method works via an OAuth2 bearer token with special scopes. That means that if you run `dispatch login` on another machine—like a CI setup—it will invalidate your other tokens. If you want to set up build machines for your game, you\'ll want to use an alternate method of authorization.\n\nFirst, find the `credentials.json` file at:\n\n- Windows: `C:\\Users\\<you>\\.dispatch\\credentials.json`\n- macOS: `~/.dispatch/credentials.json`\n\nInside that, we can use our Bot token for our application that will _not_ be invalidated across different machines.\n\n> info\n> Note that this token is only good for its owning application, so if you want to make one build machine deploy multiple applications, you\'ll need to edit this file per game.\n\nYou can get your bot token by going to your app in the Dev Portal --\x3e `Bot` --\x3e `Add Bot` --\x3e copy the token. In our credentials file, replace the JSON with:\n\n```json\n{\n  "BotCredentials": {\n    "application_id": "my_application_id",\n    "token": "my_token"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nVoila! You can now use dispatch for that application with this token.\n\nONWARDS!\n\n## Creating Branches\n\n> warn\n> If you have not yet set up a Team and an application, please follow the steps in [Get Set Up](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/get-set-up)\n\nNow that we\'re set up to use the tool, let\'s make some branches! Branches, builds, and everything in between in Discord are tied to an application. To get one for your game, ask a Discord team member to hook you up!\n\nThen, head over to our [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/), click into that new application, and copy the `Client Id` at the top of the page, keeping it handy throughout this process. Client ID and "application id" are interchangeable phrases. For the rest of this documentation, we\'ll refer to it as application id.\n\nBack to your terminal, type:\n\n```\ndispatch branch create <application_id> <branch_name>\n```\n\nThis will create a named branch under that application id that can be pushed to. You can see your branches with:\n\n```\ndispatch branch list <application_id>\n```\n\n## Setting Up Our First Build\n\nIn order for Discord to understand what you\'re sending, you need to set up a config file for your game. This config file tells Discord which files to bundle together, how to run them, and other metadata to include. You should keep this file safe in your version control system of choice; that way, Discord is always up to date with whatever you\'ve got locally. You\'ll reference these manifests later when building your store pages, so that Discord knows what to download to someone\'s computer when they hit that Big Buy Button.\n\nLet\'s break an example `config.json` file down into pieces, and then put it together at the end.\n\n## Basic Information\n\n```js\n{\n  "application": {\n    "id": 467102538279999224,\n    "manifests": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is the top level of the config file. It has an `application` object at the top. `id` is your application id. `manifests` are the heart of this file, and offer a lot of customization for tagging and uploading data for the build. Let\'s jump into that now.\n\n## Labels, Platforms, and Local Roots\n\n```js\n{\n  "label": "my-awesome-game/windows",\n  "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n  "locales": [],\n  "local_root": "./game-files/windows",\n  "redistributables": [\n    "directx_june_2010"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWe\'re in the heart of a manifest now! `label` is the name you want to give an individual manifest/bundle of files. Make these easily identifiable so you can reference them later in your store page creation.\n\n`platforms` are the platforms for which the manifest is valid. Most simple configs, like our example, will use the same manifest for `win32` and `win64`, and then make other manifests for `macos` and `linux`. However, some older games may need specific configurations for 32bit and 64bit systems, and therefore need separate manifests.\n\n`locales` is an array of locales for which the manifest is valid; leaving it empty denotes it\'s valid for all locales. For example, your base game files will probably have an empty `locales` array, but you may other manifests for things like language packs defined for `es-ES` or `fr` or other locales.\n\n`local_root` is the relative path to the directory that contains the raw game files to upload for this manifest. This may be particularly useful if you have multiple manifests with different relative root directories, like:\n\n```json\n// Imaginary directory structure:\n// C:\\game\\binary\n// C:\\game\\langs\\en-US\n// C:\\game\\langes\\fr\n\n{\n  "manifests": [\n    {\n      "label": "game-files",\n      "local_root": "binary"\n    },\n    {\n      "label": "english-language-pack",\n      "local_root": "en-US"\n    },\n    {\n      "label": "french-language-pack",\n      "local_root": "fr"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThat way, you can `dispatch build push` from your actual root directory, but dispatch will be smart enough to separate the files properly.\n\n`redistributables` is an array of any redistributable packages your game may need to function, like a certain install of DirectX, or a Microsoft C++ redistributable. A list of valid values can be found in [Field Values](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/).\n\n## File Rules\n\n```js\n{\n  "file_rules": {\n    "mappings": [\n      {\n        "local_path": ".",\n        "install_path": "."\n      },\n      {\n        "local_path": "./languages/en-US/no-but-the-data-is-really-in-here/",\n        "install_path": "./english"\n      }\n    ],\n    "properties": [\n      {\n        "install_path": "save/*",\n        "attributes": ["user_data"]\n      }\n    ],\n    "exclusions": [\n      {\n        "local_path": "**/*.pdb"\n      },\n      {\n        "local_path": "**/*.verycoolfile"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFile rules is a special, and somewhat confusing, part of the manifest, but we\'ll get through it together! The `file_rules` object lets you:\n\n1. Specify the way in which files get installed on a user\'s computer\n2. Mark files as protected, so they don\'t get overwritten\n3. Exclude certain files from being uploaded\n\n`mappings` lets you tell Dispatch to download files to a certain place in the install directory on a user\'s machine, letting you create the folder structure you need. Your game build files may be tucked deep in a subdirectory on your machine, because who ever cleans up folder structures, but you can make sure it looks nice and clean for your players.\n\n`properties` allows you to mark properties on globs of files. In this case, marking a glob of files as `user_data` tells Dispatch not to touch these files in any way if it sees them; don\'t want that save data overwritten!\n\n`exclusions` also allow you to mark off globs of files. File globs here will not be uploaded by Dispatch on a build push. In the above example, debug files that match the `*.pdb` or `*.verycoolfile` patterns in any directory will be ignored.\n\n> warn\n> Dispatch supports [Rust globbing patterns](https://docs.rs/glob/0.2.11/glob/struct.Pattern.html).\n\n## Cloud Storage\n\n```js\n{\n  "storage": {\n    "sync": true,\n    "roots": [\n      {\n        "id": "my-save-files",\n        "paths": [\n          {\n            "platform": "windows",\n            "path": "${DOCUMENTS}/My Games/My Awesome Game/Saves"\n          },\n          {\n            "platform": "macos",\n            "path": "${DOCUMENTS}/Games/My Awesome Game/Saves"\n          }\n        ],\n        "patterns": ["**/*"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDiscord supports cloud saves! Let\'s learn how to use it! This piece of the manifest, `storage`, helps Discord support cloud saves for your game. When `sync` is set to `true`, Discord will look in the `paths` provided here for any files that match one of the `patterns`. If it finds any, it will sync them to the cloud, so your user will have access to them across machines.\n\nIf you are **not** using our [Storage Manager](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORAGE/) to manage your game\'s save files, make sure to outline your save paths and file glob patterns here.\n\nIf you **are** using the Storage Manager in the GameSDK, just set `sync` to `true` and omit the `roots` key.\n\n> danger\n> `id` must be a constant, immutable value once set. You can pick whatever you\'d like when first set, but ensure it does not change afterwards. Otherwise, Discord may incorrectly overwrite and/or delete users\' save data.\n\nWe support a number of filepath replacements/shorteners like `{$DOCUMENTS}`, so you can have something like `${SAVEDGAMES}/My Awesome Game/${USERID}` and create user-specific save files. No longer will you need to worry about your little brother overwriting your save file! For the full list of path replacements, see [Cloud Save Path Replacements](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/manifests-cloud-save-path-replacements).\n\nAs a side note, there may be a case where you might have multiple manifests that each have storage information defined. In the case that the two manifests define the same storage path but have _conflicting_ data, the source of truth will be the manifest that appears **later** in the array in the config file. So, if you have:\n\n```js\n{\n  "manifests": [\n    {\n      "label": "one",\n      "storage": {\n        "sync": true,\n        "roots": [\n          {\n            "id": "one",\n            "paths": [\n              {\n                "platform": "windows",\n                "path": "${HOME}"\n              }\n            ],\n            "patterns": ["**/*"]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      "label": "two",\n      "storage": {\n        "sync": true,\n        "roots": [\n          {\n            "id": "two",\n            "paths": [\n              {\n                "platform": "windows",\n                "path": "${HOME}"\n              }\n            ],\n            "patterns": ["**/*"]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThen, manifest `two` would be the source of truth in a data conflict. Wew, ok, good work. On to the next part!\n\n## Registry Keys and Install Scripts\n\n```js\n{\n  "install_scripts": [\n    {\n      "name": "SDB Compatibility",\n      "executable": "Install.bat",\n      "arguments": ["/silent"],\n      "requires_admin": true,\n      "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n      "completion_registry_key": {\n        "key": "Software\\\\My Game Company\\\\InstallScripts\\\\SDB-win32",\n        "value": 1\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  "registry_keys": [\n    {\n      "key": "Software\\\\My Game Company\\\\My Awesome Game\\\\FixAspctRatio",\n      "value": "1"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSome games may need specific registry keys set after installation, or might have some installation scripts that need to be run. If so, those can be set here!\n\nFor installation scripts, `name` is a user friendly name that Discord will surface to users when explaining what\'s happening during the installation process. `executable` is the name of the script that needs to be run. `arguments` is an array that takes any arguments that may need to be passed to the script. `requires_admin`, when marked `true`, will run the install scripts with admin privileges; for some Windows users, this may force a User Access Control security popup. You must also tell Discord the `completion_registry_key` of the scripts, so that we know not to try and run the script again if the given registry key is found on the user\'s machine.\n\n`registry_keys` is a simple array of key/value pairs that will be written to the user\'s computer\'s registry. By default, Discord will create these keys in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`. If your game requires registry keys in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`, they can be specified like:\n\n```js\n{\n  "key": "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\My Game Company\\\\My Awesome Game\\\\MagicFix",\n  "value": "1"\n}\n```\n\nDon\'t forget to the notice the double backward slashes in the path name!\n\n## Launch Options\n\n```js\n{\n  "launch_options": [\n    {\n      "name": "My Awesome Game",\n      "executable": "my-awesome-game.exe",\n      "arguments": [],\n      "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n      "working_dir": "important-files-here/"\n    },\n    {\n      "name": "My Awesome Map Editor",\n      "executable": "my-awesome-map-editor.exe",\n      "arguments": [],\n      "platforms": ["win32", "win64"],\n      "working_dir": "important-files-here/"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe last bit of the config file is the launch options for your game. This is where you should tell Discord which executables your game can launch. In most cases, you\'ll just have one object, which is the main executable for your game. However, in the case that your game may have multiple executables that users can launch, you can specify all of them here.\n\n> warn\n> The `name` field _must_ be unique for each launch option.\n\nWhen launching the game from their Game Library, players will be able to choose which executable is being launched, with the first option in the list as the default. So, for example, if your game comes with the game and a map editor, they\'ll have access to both without needing multiple entries in their library. Discord will smartly remember their choice for the future, but they\'ll always have the option to swap to a different one if they want.\n\nYou can also specify any arguments that need to be passed to your game on launch, like `--fullscreen` or `--console` or `--360-no-scope`.\n\nIf your game needs to have a specific working directly, you can also specify that here. Otherwise we\'ll default to the `content/` folder in the install directory.\n\n> danger\n> Currently, `executable` and `working_dir` are relative to the _install path_ on a user\'s machine, not your local root.

Oftentimes in newer games, a user purchasing DLC content does not necessarily mean them downloading additional files to their computer, like expansion packs of ye olden days. A game will see that a user is entitled to a new thing, some flag in the code will flip, and presto! They can now explore the new area.\n\nHowever, some games do rely on downloading additional files for DLC content. If that is the case with your game, let\'s see how Dispatch can help. What\'s gonna help here is making use of multiple manifests. When you create a `config.json` file to upload your game, you\'ve got something that looks sort of like this:\n\n```json\n// A much smaller config example than the behemoth just above\n{\n  "application": {\n    "id": 1234567890,\n    "manifests": [\n      {\n        // a bunch of stuff\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n"manifests" is an array, which means it can contain multiple items. What you\'ll want to do is create two manifests: one for your base game, and one for your DLC. Depending on how your build folder is set up, you can exclude the DLC files from being uploaded when you upload the base game. Let\'s pretend your build folder—the one on your local computer that you\'re uploading from—looks like this:\n\n```\ngame/\n|_ config.json\n|_ build/\n   |_ game_data\n      |_ Assets/\n          |_ AssetBundles/\n             |_ Base/\n             |_ DLC/\n```\n\nYour manifest would look something like this:\n\n```\n{\n  "application": {\n    "id": your_app_id,\n    "manifests": [\n      {\n        "label": "base-game",\n        "local_root": "build",\n        "file_rules": {\n          "mappings": [\n            {\n              "local_path": ".",      // This makes the files appear in the base content/ directory, trust me :D\n              "install_path": "."\n            }\n          ],\n          "exclusions": [\n            {\n              "local_path": "./game_data/Assets/AssetBundles/DLC"    // This manifest will NOT include the DLC\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        // The rest of the config with launch options, etc.\n      },\n      {\n        "label": "dlc", // Now we have a second manifest for the DLC files\n        "local_root": "build/game_data/Assets/AssetBundles/DLC", // Uploading files from the DLC folder\n        "file_rules": {\n          "mappings": [\n            {\n              "local_path": ".",\n              "install_path": "./game_data/Assets/AssetBundles/DLC" // Puts the DLC in the proper folder structure\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo, what we\'ve done is defined two manifests—or bundles of files—in one config. Now, how do we make \'em work?\n\nWhen you create SKUs in the dev portal, you assign manifests to SKUs. You\'ll want to assign `base-game`​ to your base game SKU, and `dlc` ​to your DLC. Now, when players buy your base game, they\'ll get entitlement to the `base-game` manifest, and Discord will only download that one. Once they purchase `dlc`, they\'ll become entitled to that manifest, and Discord will patch the game with the new content they received.\n\n## DRM\n\nYou can choose to add DRM to your game. Dispatch will wrap your executables and prevent a user from launching the game if they are not logged into Discord.\n\n> danger\n> This is a destructive operation. It will wrap your executable in place. It will not back up your executable. Make sure you have a backup somewhere else.\n\nIf you understand and agree to the above, run the following command on each of the executables you want to wrap.\n\n```\ndispatch build drm-wrap <application_id> <path_to_executable_to_wrap>\n```\n\nThis function will only work with Windows executables. If you want to wrap a unix executable, you\'ll need to instead use [ValidateOrExit](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_APPLICATIONS/validateorexit).\n\n## Pushing Our First Build\n\nWe\'ve got all our files ready for processing; let\'s ship this baby!\n\n```\ndispatch build push <branch_id> <path_to_config> <path_to_files_to_upload>\n```\n\nYou\'ll see a bunch of request logging as it gets sent up to Discord—when it\'s done, you\'re greeted with a friendly completion message:\n\n```\n[2018-06-14][11:38:51][INFO] Pushed build. build_id=456889899375656960\n```\n\nTo double check that it\'s all ready for publishing, run:\n\n```\ndispatch build list <application_id> <branch_id>\n```\n\nYou\'ll see a table with the current status of your builds. Once the one you uploaded is marked as READY, you\'re good to publish it to the masses!\n\n## Publishing Our First Build\n\nOnce you\'re ready to make a build live, run:\n\n```\ndispatch build publish <application_id> <branch_id> <build_id>\n```\n\nTo make sure it worked, you can again run:\n\n```\ndispatch branch list <application_id>\n```\n\nAnd look for a `LIVE_BUILD_ID` under your application!\n\n## Downloading a Build for Testing\n\nNow that you\'ve got a build pushed and published, we should make sure that what you\'ve sent out into the world works as intended. You can download your published build on a given branch to your local machine with the command:\n\n```\ndispatch build update <application_id> <branch_id> <install_path> --platform <value> --locale <value>\n```\n\n`install_path` is any filepath on your local machine; this is where the files will be downloaded to. `--platform` and `--locale` are whatever values you set as valid platforms and locales in your config file for a given build. The default probably looks something like `win64` and `en-US`.\n\nHere\'s an example of the command with our info:\n\n```\ndispatch build update 467102538279999224 456889899375659999 C:\\my-game --platform win64 --locale en-US\n```\n\nNow you can run the executable for your game in that directory and make sure it works!\n\n## Patching\n\nIf you need to push out a patch or a new build, no problem! Just repeat the process:\n\n- Update your game files locally to whatever they need to be\n- Push your build again\n- Publish the build again\n- List your branches to make sure the new build is live\n\nDiscord will do some magic in the background to diff your files, ensuring that your players only have to download the changes they need and letting them do it quickly so they can get back in the game. Or, really, without them even needing to know there _was_ a patch! Your players will automatically download your latest and greatest stuff, and quickly!\n\nIf you have your own patcher and do not want Discord to handle patching, set `"should_patch": false` in the application configuration. If `should_patch` is false, Discord will install the game and never patch, even if you update your game. On uninstall, Discord will delete the entire directory, including saves and user data.\n\n```js\n{\n  "application": {\n    "id": 467102538279999224,\n    "should_patch": false,\n  }\n}\n```\n'

Talk to us in the [Discord Developers Server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers)!\n\nSome people don't like to read full pages of documentation. Personally, I think those people are missing out. But we want to make sure that we cater to everyone, so here's a list of every Dispatch command and what it does. No frills, no jokes. Okay, maybe some jokes.\n\n## login\n\nAuthorizes you to do these things!\n\n###### Arguments\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```\n-> dispatch login\n[2018-09-17][15:26:15][INFO] Already logged in\n```\n\n## branch create\n\nCreates a new branch. If you have not yet made a master branch, this command will also automatically create a master branch.\n\n###### Arguments\n\n| name           | values | description                   |\n| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |\n| application_id | int    | your application ID/client ID |\n| branch_name    | string | the name for your new branch  |\n\n###### Example\n\n```\n-> dispatch branch create 290926444748734465 \"test\"\nBranch created with id 491362538965958686\n```\n\n## branch delete\n\nDeletes a branch.\n\n###### Arguments\n\n| name           | values | description                    |\n| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |\n| application_id | int    | your application ID/client ID  |\n| branch_id      | int    | the id of the branch to delete |\n\n###### Example\n\n```\n-> dispatch branch delete 290926444748734465 491362538965958686\n```\n\n## branch list\n\nLists all branches for an application.\n\n###### Arguments\n\n| name           | values | description                   |\n| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |\n| application_id | int    | your application ID/client ID |\n\n###### Example\n\n```\n-> dispatch branch list 290926444748734465\n|    APPLICATION ID    |      BRANCH ID       |         NAME         |    LIVE_BUILD_ID     |           CREATED AT           |\n| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n|  290926444748734465  |  471164707759996234  |  master              |                      |  2018-07-24 04:00:20.146588Z   |\n```\n\n## branch promote\n\nPromotes the live build of one branch to another.\n\n###### Arguments\n\n| name             | values | description                       |\n| ---------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |\n| application_id   | int    | your application ID/client ID     |\n| branch_id        | int    | the id of the branch to promote   |\n| target_branch_id | int    | the id of the branch to overwrite |\n\n###### Example\n\n```\n-> dispatch branch promote 290926444748734465 471164707759996234 491362538965958686\n```\n\n## build delete\n\nDeletes a build from a branch.\n\n###### Arguments\n\n| name           | values | description                   |\n| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |\n| application_id | int    | your application ID/client ID |\n| build_id       | int    | the id of the build to delete |\n\n###### Example\n\n```\n-> dispatch build delete 290926444748734465 491362538965958686\n```\n\n## build drm-wrap\n\nWraps your executable in Discord's DRM.

e.exports="# Alpha and Beta Testing\n\nAlphas and betas are a critical part of a game's development lifecycle. We understand the value of getting feedback early and often and involving your community early on. That's why we've built some awesome alpha and beta testing functionality for you!\n\n## Beta Entitlements\n\nAs you develop your game, you'll constantly be making improvements. You want real-time feedback from players, and there's no better place for that than Discord. In the past, players would need to dig through menus to find out how to unlock test branches, as well as remembering secret passwords _and_ typing them in correctly. Was that an `I` or an `l`? `O` or `0`?\n\nOne of the cool features of [Store Channels](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_SPECIAL_CHANNELS/) is their ability to grant a Beta Entitlement for your game. That means that while you keep your master branch safe and sound, users can test on `beta-branch-please-ignore-bugs` in an isolated test environment.\n\n> info\n> To learn more about creating branches, start with [Dispatch and You](#DOCS_DISPATCH_DISPATCH_AND_YOU/).\n\nWhen you create a store channel in your server, you'll be prompted with a choice to make it a Beta channel. That will allow you to grant users entitlement to the non-master branch of your game when visiting the store page. When your beta period is over and your game is ready for release and purchase, you can brick/delete these branches if you choose, and prompt users to get the full game by putting up a new store channel that's not Beta.\n\n> warn\n> Beta branches cannot be sold. If a user has access to a store channel for a beta entitlement, they will be able to claim it for free.\n\n## Role-Based Entitlement\n\nSo, you've started getting a bunch of fans into your server. Hundreds, thousands, millions! Uh, if you hit millions, let us know. Within your hordes of adoring fans lies your Trusted Testing Group (tm), the best of the best when it comes to feedback. Maybe you want to give them access to a special `insider-only-private-beta` branch of your game. You can, with role-based entitlement!\n\nStore channels in Discord are just like any other channel in that they can have a set of permissions applied to them. What is special about them is that if they are set as a Beta branch, entitlement to that branch is tied to having permissions to view the channel. So, all your testers with a `Beta Tester` role, for example, will be able to get entitlement to the `insider-only-private-beta` branch. And, if they are later removed from that role, entitlement from that branch will be removed.\n\nA scenario might look like this: you create a Beta store channel. Only users with role `Awesome Tester` can view it. Player A is an `Awesome Tester`. They can view the channel and get entitlement to the beta branch. Player A becomes inactive; you remove them from the `Awesome Tester` role. Player A loses entitlement to `insider-only-private-beta`\n\n> danger\n> Role-based entitlement will only work if you use Discord's DRM, which is a simple entitlement check. You can do that with the Dispatch command [`dispatch build drm-wrap`](#DOCS_DISPATCH_LIST_OF_COMMANDS/build-drmwrap) or by calling [`ApplicationManager.ValidateOrExit()`](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_APPLICATIONS/validateorexit). Otherwise, Discord will not check the user's entitlement when the game starts.\n\nRole-based entitlements help keep your beta community active and interactive, while also providing a way to reward your biggest fans with secret access to special things.\n\n## Gift Codes\n\n> warn\n> Note that only Approved Games can generate gift codes.\n\nIf you want to push out access to your game at scale, rather than inviting people into your server and giving them a role, you can create gift codes in the Developer Portal! Gift codes are like game keys on other platforms that you might be familiar with, with an added bonus: the ability to specify the entitlement time window. That means that you can create codes for your game to give to everyone, but they won't be able to play until the `VALID FROM` date. Similarly, you can set a `VALID UNTIL` date on all your gift codes if you want the entitlements to expire after a certain time, removing access from players.\n\nNote that the `VALID UNTIL` date will not remove the game from the user's library, but they will no longer be able to launch it.\n\nUp to 25,000 gift codes can be created at a time. When you go to create gift codes, you'll notice there are a few fields for you to fill out. Here's what they mean:\n\n![Screenshot of the modal to create gift codes with on the developer dashboard](gift-code-creation.png)\n\n- SKU: the SKU that you want the user to get\n- Branch: the branch of your game you want the user to get\n- Valid From: the start date at which the entitlement is valid\n- Valid Until: the date at which the entitlement is no longer valid\n- Amount: the number of codes you want to create (up to 25,000 per batch)\n- Description: a short description of why you made the codes, so you remember!\n\nOnce you've made your codes, you can download the `.csv` that has them all in it, and distribute them however you'd like!\n"

e.exports="# How to Get Your Game on Discord\n\n> warn\n> Game approval submissions are currently paused due to unforeseen circumstances. We apologize for the inconvenience. [Click here for more info.](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041437171)\n\nWelcome, adventurer! If you're here, you want to find out how to get your game up and running on Discord and learn about our awesome Server Commerce features. You've come to the right place, so let's get started.\n\n## Get the Band Back Together\n\nFirst things first: it's time to make a Team. Your dream team of artists, writers, engineers, designers, all working on the beautiful creation of Your Game. Build your dream team with these steps:\n\n1. Create a new Team at [https://discord.com/developers/teams](https://discord.com/developers/teams)\n2. Invite people!\n\nYou've now passed the first test with flying colors!\n\n## Apps and Games\n\nThroughout this process, we'll reference your \"app\". An app, or application, is an entity on Discord that represents something you've built: a bot, an OAuth2 app, or in this case your game. We need to make an app for your game:\n\n1. Create a new app at [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)\n2. When doing so, make sure you select your team from the `Team` dropdown\n\n> info\n> All apps on Discord for games must be owned by a team. If you accidentally made a personal app, you can transfer it to a team at any time by hitting the `Transfer App to Team` button within the app.\n\nYou're now looking at a blank slate of creativity. Give your game a pretty icon and exciting description here. Next, click on `Server Commerce Checklist` in the sidebar, and we'll get to the good stuff.\n\n## Join the Club\n\nFrom here on forward, we'll be managing settings that tie directly to your game and its presence on Discord. We want to make sure that we're laser-focused on making the best experience possible for game developers, so we ask that you pay our Application License Fee in order to get access to our store tools, which let you:\n\n- make store pages for your game directly in your server\n- run alpha and beta tests for your game, using the magic of channel permissions to create role-based page access\n- apply for approval, letting you start making money (if you want to)\n\nNow that we've weeded out the trolls, let's get your server up and running with some fancy new features!\n\n## Your Server - Your Kingdom\n\nYou're now looking at a checklist with a bunch of items and a prompt to select a server. Your Application License Fee entitles you to the following features in your server:\n\n- store channel creation\n- alpha and beta testing\n\nSelect the server that you wish to grant these features, confirm to be double-extra-super-sure, and poof! You can now create channels for both news and store pages in your server. To learn more about store page channels, read [Store Channels](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_SPECIAL_CHANNELS/store-channels). To learn more about Announcement Channels, read [Announcement Channels](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_SPECIAL_CHANNELS/announcement-channels). To learn about alpha and beta testing, read [Alpha and Beta Testing](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_ALPHA_AND_BETA_TESTING/)\n(you get the gist).\n\nNow, what do you do next? You start building! Build your community, make your game, invite testers into your server to get hype! Now is a great time to get familiar with all the tools at your disposal like:\n\n- [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), your one-stop-game-management-shop\n- [The Discord Game SDK](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/), a spellbook full of useful game dev incantations including Discord's crystal-clear voice chat\n- [Dispatch](#DOCS_DISPATCH_DISPATCH_AND_YOU/), Discord's game patcher and downloader that's so fast, you'll swear it's magic\n\nTo guide you through this process to success, you can follow that handy checklist. It'll tell you the steps you need to complete, show you where and how to do them, and give you a blissful sense of satisfaction as the green check marks pile up.\n\nThe next and final step in your on-boarding journey is getting approved. Once approved, you'll be able to start making money (or karma), and you'll unlock a ton of cool server customization features to make your kingdom cozy for your players.\n\n## Testing Your Game\n\nAs you go through the process of building your game and getting it ready for release on Discord, you'll want to be able to test it! One way to do so is to utilize Beta Store channels, which you can learn more about here: [Alpha and Beta Testing](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_ALPHA_AND_BETA_TESTING/).\n\nIf you are on the Team that owns the game, you can also use another special system for testing that we call Application Test Mode. Test Mode allows you to purchase unavailable, unlisted SKUs for free, making it helpful for testing IAP flows. It also automatically makes every branch of your game show up in your Library when Test Mode is turned on. You can read more here: [Application Test Mode](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORE/application-test-mode).\n\n## Getting Approved\n\nYour game looks wonderful. You've got a beautiful store page, and awesome game, and an eager community. It's time to get approved and plant your flag. Note that if your game is in an alpha or beta state, or you're interesting in Early Access, you are welcome to apply for approval whenever you are ready. Your game doesn't need to be the finished 1.0 version; give us something you'd feel comfortable giving to your players.\n\nOnce you've completed all the items on your checklist, the `Get Approved` button will unlock. Once you submit for approval, Discord will take a look at the following things:\n\n- your game, to ensure that it runs properly and follows our [Game Submission Guidelines](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025028592-Game-Submission-Guidelines)\n- your store pages, to provide helpful guidance in putting your best foot forward\n- your server, to make sure you're abiding by our [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)\n\nIf we need to see some changes, you'll receive an email directing you on your steps to success. Otherwise, you'll get **APPROVED!!!!!!!!!!** What's that mean? It means you can start charging for your game and making money! Don't spend it all in one place. Or do. Treat yourself. Or maybe you want your game to be **free!** Live your best life. We support you!\n\n## Available vs Store Page Published\n\nNow that you've been approved, there's a couple new toggles to flip in the Developer Portal: `Available`, and `Store Page Published`.\n\n![Screenshot of the SKU information page with the \"available\" and \"store page published\" switches highlighted](available-published.png)\n\n`Available` means that your game is now available for normal purchase/distribution; your non-beta store channel will no longer say `Coming soon!` when this is toggled, and users will be able to get your game.\n\n> danger\n> Toggling your SKU as `Available` will make it available for purchase; make sure your price is set properly!\n\nIf you no longer wish to make your SKU available for sale, you can again mark it unavailable. This will not remove it from users' libraries; it just stops new users from purchasing it.\n\n`Store Page Published` will do...well, what it says! Though your store page is always visible from within the channel in your server, there are other things that require you to explicitly mark your page viewable from outside that context, like gift code embeds for your game, or from in-game store fronts!\n\nTL;DR - When you're ready to distribute your game after getting approved, turn those two toggles on.\n\n## Getting Verified and Discovered\n\nApart from being approved, you can also get your server Verified. Getting verified means your server will get that oh-so-exclusive checkmark, to let people know you're the legit home for your game. \n\nTo get verified, head on over to our [Verification page](https://discord.com/verification) and fill out the form at the bottom.\n\n## Make Good Decisions\n\nYour game is off and running, and we couldn't be more proud. As it flourishes and your playerbase grows, keep an eye on your analytics, which you can find within your app. They'll give you important insight like revenue data, acquisitions funnels, and player retention to help you make informed decision about your game's lifecycle. Check out our [Analytics Help Article](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024852152) to learn more about how to read all those charts, and how to do things like [Conversion Tracking with UTM Links](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025153051-How-to-track-conversions-with-UTM-links).\n\n## What Comes Next\n\nYour game's success is in your own hands now. Continue to build your community and keep them informed with updates. Consider integrating more deeply with Discord to deliver cool features to your players; we recommend [Rich Presence Game Invites](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/). They feel like magic. Drop new content by creating DLC and IAP for your game, run fun tournaments based on [HypeSquad Membership](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_USERS/currentuserhasflag), give something cool to [Discord Nitro Subscribers](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_USERS/getcurrentuserpremiumtype) because they're awesome. Or maybe, just maybe, think about your next upcoming game?\n\nWe'd love to help you with that one, too.\n\n-- Discord <3\n"

e.exports="# Store Channels\n\nOne of the new flagship features of Verified Servers and Game Servers are the ability to host your store pages directly in your server. We know that community is everything for games, and that your server is already the place where your community lives. Rather than the friction and impersonality of traditional storefronts, you can let your fans find your game in the cozy comfort of their home (your server!).\n\nIn order to create a store channel for your game, you'll need to make sure you've followed [the Walkthrough](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_HOW_TO_GET_YOUR_GAME_ON_DISCORD/) up to `Getting Approved`. If you've done that, you'll see in your server that you can create a new channel type: `Store`.\n\n![Screenshot of the modal to create a new Store Channel](create-store-channel.png)\n\nAlong with entering a name for your new channel, you'll be prompted to select an application. This should be the app you created when you started; it's the one linked to your server. After selecting your app, you'll be prompted to select a SKU. What's a SKU? A SKU is simply a thing that a user can buy. This is most likely your game (a SKU of type `Game`), but could also be `IAP`, `DLC`, or a `Bundle`.\n\nYou can create SKUs to put up for sale by going to your app and selecting `SKU Management`.\n\n![Screenshot of the SKU Management dashboard](sku-management.png)\n\nOnce you select your SKU and create your channel...it's there! You now have a store channel in your server! If you want, you can set permissions on this channel like any channel in a server to restrict who can see it. Learn more about that by reading [Alpha and Beta Testing](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_ALPHA_AND_BETA_TESTING/).\n\n## Lurker Mode\n\nStore channels also have a special property that we call `lurkability`. \"Lurker Mode\" is a feature that we've been experimenting with throughout Discord; it allows users to read public channels in a server without _actually_ joining the server. It also allows users to look at these channels without being logged in to Discord.\n\n> info\n> Users viewing channels in Lurker Mode will not be able to send messages in those channels. They'll be prompted to log in and join the server if they want to chat.\n\nLurker Mode is automatically enabled for store channels in your server. When someone accepts a server invite that links to a store channel, they'll be viewing in \"Lurker Mode\".\n\nWe know that your server and community are at the heart of your game's success on Discord. Having Discord users see your store pages in the context of your server will help drive more members to your community and help you grow that awesome fanbase for your game.\n\n# Announcement Channels\n\nAs part of our ongoing effort to help you build your game community, all [Community servers](https://dis.gd/communityservers) (along with [Developer License](#DOCS_GAME_AND_SERVER_MANAGEMENT_HOW_TO_GET_YOUR_GAME_ON_DISCORD/your-server-your-kingdom) servers) have the ability to create Announcement Channels!\n\nUnlike a regular text channel, Announcement Channels comes with a “Follow” button that allows your superfans to hook and connect your channel into their own personal servers. Now, select messages in your Announcement Channels can be \"published\" in your players' friend servers as regular messages, allowing them to get the latest updates of their favorite game in the places they hang out most. Because these posts appear and function as messages, it means that everyone in your superfan’s server can find them, discuss them live, and receive them as mobile notifications, if they have this setting enabled.\n\n[Learn more here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192).\n"

[Click here for more info.](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041437171)\n\nThere\'s no feeling quite like accomplishing a goal that you\'ve set out to achieve. Is killing 1000 zombies in a game as great an achievement as climbing Mt. Everest? Of course it is, and I didn\'t even have to leave my house. So get off my back, society.\n\nAnyway—Discord has achievements! Show your players just how successful they are.\n\nAchievements are managed in the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Head over to your application --\x3e `Achievements` to create and manage achievements for your game. You\'ll give them an icon, a name, and a description; then they\'ll be assigned an id.\n\nYou can also mark achievements as `secret` and `secure`. "Secret" achievements will _not_ be shown to the user until they\'ve unlocked them. "Secure" achievements can only be set via HTTP calls from your server, _not_ by a game client using the SDK. No cheaters here!\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### Achievement Struct\n\n| name           | type    | description                                                                                                                                  |\n| -------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| application_id | Int64   | the unique id of the application                                                                                                             |\n| name           | object  | the name of the achievement as an [achievement locale object](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACHIEVEMENTS/data-models-achievement-locale-object)             |\n| description    | object  | the user-facing achievement description as an [achievement locale object](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACHIEVEMENTS/data-models-achievement-locale-object) |\n| secret         | boolean | if the achievement is secret                                                                                                                 |\n| secure         | boolean | if the achievement is secure                                                                                                                 |\n| id             | Int64   | the unique id of the achievement                                                                                                             |\n| icon_hash      | string  | [the hash of the icon](#DOCS_REFERENCE/image-formatting)                                                                                     |\n\n###### Achievement Locale Object\n\n| Name           | Description                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| default        | the default locale for the achievement                                                                                                                  |\n| localizations? | object of [accepted locales](#DOCS_DISPATCH_FIELD_VALUES/predefined-field-values-accepted-locales) as the key and achievement translations as the value |\n\n###### User Achievement Struct\n\n| name            | type   | description                                                                                |\n| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| UserId          | Int64  | the unique id of the user working on the achievement                                       |\n| AchievementId   | Int64  | the unique id of the achievement                                                           |\n| PercentComplete | UInt8  | how far along the user is to completing the achievement (0-100)                            |\n| UnlockedAt      | string | the timestamp at which the user completed the achievement (PercentComplete was set to 100) |\n\n## SetUserAchievement\n\nUpdates the current user\'s status for a given achievement.

If the user has any achievements, do your iteration within the callback of this function.\n\nReturns `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n> info\n> Remember to only iterate when there are results!\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone.\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nachievementManager.FetchUserAchievements((res) =>\n{\n  if (res == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    // Count()\n    // for() loop\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## CountUserAchievements\n\nCounts the list of a user\'s achievements for iteration.\n\nReturns `Int32`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nachievementManager.FetchUserAchievements((res) =>\n{\n  if (res == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("User has {0} achievements for this game", achievementManager.CountUserAchievements());\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## GetUserAchievementAt\n\nGets the user\'s achievement at a given index of their list of achievements.\n\nReturns `Discord.UserAchievement`\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name  | type  | description                               |\n| ----- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |\n| index | Int32 | the index at which to get the achievement |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nachievementManager.FetchUserAchievements((res) =>\n{\n  if (res == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    for (int i = 0; i < achievementManager.CountUserAchievements(); i++)\n    {\n      var achievement = achievementManager.GetUserAchievementAt(i);\n      Console.WriteLine("Achievement progress for {0} for user {1}: {2}",\n                        achievement.AchievementId,\n                        achievement.UserId,\n                        achievement.PercentComplete);\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## GetUserAchievement\n\nGets the user achievement for the given achievement id. If you keep a hardcoded mapping of achievement <--\x3e id in your codebase, this will be better than iterating over each achievement. Make sure to call `FetchUserAchievements()` first still!\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name          | type  | description                      |\n| ------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |\n| achievementId | Int64 | the id of the achievement to get |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nachievementManager.FetchUserAchievements((res) =>\n{\n  if (res == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    var achievement = achievementManager.GetUserAchievement(580159119969878046);\n    Console.WriteLine("Achievement progress for {0} for user {1}: {2}",\n                      achievement.AchievementId,\n                      achievement.UserId,\n                      achievement.PercentComplete);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## OnUserAchievementUpdate\n\nFires when an achievement is updated for the currently connected user\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name        | type                | description                      |\n| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| achievement | ref UserAchievement | the achievement that was updated |\n\n## The API Way\n\nBelow are the API endpoints and the parameters they accept. If you choose to interface directly with the Discord API, you will need a "Bot token". This is a special authorization token with which your application can access Discord\'s HTTP API. Head on over to [your app\'s dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/), and hit the big "Add a Bot User" button. From there, mutter _abra kadabra_ and reveal the token. This token is used as an authorization header against our API like so:\n\n```\ncurl -x POST -h "Authorization: Bot <your token>" https://discord.com/api/some-route/that-does-a-thing\n```\n\n> info\n> Make sure to prepend your token with "Bot"!\n\n## Get Achievements\n\n`GET https://discord.com/api/v6/applications/<application_id>/achievements`\n\nReturns all achievements for the given application.

This might be a custom protocol, like `my-awesome-game://`, or a path to an executable. It also supports any launch parameters that may be needed, like `game.exe --full-screen --no-hax`.\n\nOn macOS, due to the way Discord registers executables, your game needs to be bundled for this command to work. That means it should be a `.app`.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type   | description             |\n| ------- | ------ | ----------------------- |\n| command | string | the command to register |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nactivityManager.RegisterCommand("my-awesome-game://run --full-screen");\n```\n\n## RegisterSteam\n\nUsed if you are distributing this SDK on Steam. Registers your game\'s Steam app id for the protocol `steam://run-game-id/<id>`.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type   | description              |\n| ------- | ------ | ------------------------ |\n| steamId | UInt32 | your game\'s Steam app id |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nactivityManager.RegisterSteam(1938123);\n```\n\n## UpdateActivity\n\nSets a user\'s presence in Discord to a new activity. This has a rate limit of 5 updates per 20 seconds.\n\n> info\n> It is possible for users to hide their presence on Discord (User Settings -> Game Activity). Presence set through this SDK may not be visible when this setting is toggled off.\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name     | type     | description                   |\n| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |\n| activity | Activity | the new activity for the user |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar activity = new Discord.Activity\n{\n  State = "In Play Mode",\n  Details = "Playing the Trumpet!",\n  Timestamps =\n  {\n      Start = 5,\n  },\n  Assets =\n  {\n      LargeImage = "foo largeImageKey", // Larger Image Asset Key\n      LargeText = "foo largeImageText", // Large Image Tooltip\n      SmallImage = "foo smallImageKey", // Small Image Asset Key\n      SmallText = "foo smallImageText", // Small Image Tooltip\n  },\n  Party =\n  {\n      Id = "foo partyID",\n      Size = {\n          CurrentSize = 1,\n          MaxSize = 4,\n      },\n  },\n  Secrets =\n  {\n      Match = "foo matchSecret",\n      Join = "foo joinSecret",\n      Spectate = "foo spectateSecret",\n  },\n  Instance = true,\n};\n\nactivityManager.UpdateActivity(activity, (result) =>\n{\n    if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine("Success!");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine("Failed");\n    }\n});\n```\n\n## ClearActivity\n\nClear\'s a user\'s presence in Discord to make it show nothing.\n\nResults a `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nactivityManager.ClearActivity((result) =>\n{\n    if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine("Success!");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine("Failed");\n    }\n});\n```\n\n## SendRequestReply\n\nSends a reply to an Ask to Join request.\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type                     | description                                 |\n| ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |\n| userId | Int64                    | the user id of the person who asked to join |\n| reply  | ActivityJoinRequestReply | No, Yes, or Ignore                          |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nactivityManager.OnActivityJoinRequest += user =>\n{\n    Console.WriteLine("Join request from: {0}", user.Id);\n    activityManager.SendRequestReply(user.Id, Discord.ActivityJoinRequestReply.Yes, (res) =>\n    {\n      if (res == Discord.Result.Ok)\n      {\n        Console.WriteLine("Responded successfully");\n      }\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## SendInvite\n\nSends a game invite to a given user. If you do not have a valid activity with all the required fields, this call will error.

If one of those many games is yours, then we\'ve got something for you! This manager gives you access to a bearer token for the currently connected Discord user, which you can send off to your server to do user authentication.\n\nThis token is also useful for retrieving information about the connected user\'s account. Check out our [OAuth2 documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) for more information.\n\nThese bearer tokens are good for seven days, after which they will expire. When a user reconnects to your game, and is online and connected to the internet, they\'ll receive a new token that you can grab.\n\nThis manager also includes a couple useful helper functions, like getting the locale in which the user has chosen to use their Discord client, and knowing which game branch the game is running on. More about branches in the Dispatch CLI tool section of the documentation.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### OAuth2Token Struct\n\n| name        | type   | description                                                                                     |\n| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| AccessToken | string | a bearer token for the current user                                                             |\n| Scopes      | string | a list of oauth2 scopes as a single string, delineated by spaces like `"identify rpc gdm.join"` |\n| Expires     | Int64  | the timestamp at which the token expires                                                        |\n\n###### SignedAppTicket Struct\n\n| name           | type                                                                                                                     | description                                              |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| application_id | Int64                                                                                                                    | the application id for the ticket                        |\n| user           | [User](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_USERS/data-models-user-struct)                                                                      | the user for the ticket                                  |\n| entitlements   | list of partial [Entitlements](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORE/data-models-entitlement-struct) structs that contain just the SKU id | the list of the user\'s entitlements for this application |\n| timestamp      | string                                                                                                                   | the ISO 8601 timestamp for the ticket                    |\n\n## GetCurrentLocale\n\n> info\n> Value from environment variable `DISCORD_CURRENT_LOCALE`\n\nGet\'s the locale the current user has Discord set to.\n\nReturns a `string`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar locale = applicationManager.GetCurrentLocale();\nConsole.WriteLine("This user\'s language is {0}", locale);\n```\n\n## GetCurrentBranch\n\n> info\n> Value from environment variable `DISCORD_CURRENT_BRANCH`\n\nGet the name of pushed branch on which the game is running.

The structure of the ticket is: `version.signature.base64encodedjson`, so you should split the string by the `.` character. Ensure that the `version` matches the current version. The `signature` is used to verify the ticket using the libsodium library of your choice, and the `base64encodedjson` is what you can transform after verification. It contains:\n\n- the application id tied to the ticket\n- the user\'s user id\n- a timestamp for the ticket\n- the list of the user\'s [entitlements](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORE/data-models-entitlement-struct) for the application id\n\nThese values can be accessed by transforming the string into a [SignedAppTicket](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_APPLICATIONS/data-models-signedappticket-struct) with your application\'s private key. The ticket is signed using [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) which should be available for any programming language. Here\'s a [list of available libraries](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/bindings_for_other_languages).\n\nNote that both the public key you receive from Discord and the signature within the app ticket from the SDK are both in hex, and will need to be converted to `byte[]` before use with libsodium.\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` and `ref string` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\n// Handle serialization however works best for you\n// This is just an easy example\n[Serializable]\npublic class SignedAppTicket\n{\n  public long application_id;\n  public Discord.User user;\n  public List<Discord.Entitlement> entitlements;\n  public string timestamp;\n}\n\npublic void DoTheThing()\n{\n  // This example is using the libsodium-net library\n  // https://github.com/adamcaudill/libsodium-net\n  var appManager = discord.GetApplicationManager();\n  var MY_PUBLIC_KEY = "460cab5f2237b71e3c2c06bzze217f4f68d55db16dae672bdfb6618235589999";\n  var MY_SKU_ID = "492432195219099999";\n\n  // Get the ticket\n  appManager.GetTicket((Discord.Result res, ref string ticket) =>\n  {\n    // Split the ticket into its parts\n    var parts = ticket.Split(\'.\');\n\n    // Ensure the version matches\n    if(parts[0] == "2")\n    {\n      // Verify the signature\n      // Your public key will be given to you by Discord\n      if (Sodium.PublicKeyAuth.VerifyDetached(HexToByte(parts[1]), System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(parts[2]), HexToByte(MY_PUBLIC_KEY)))\n      {\n        // If valid, decode the string\n        var byteData = Convert.FromBase64String(parts[2]);\n        var json = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(byteData);\n\n        // Deserialize it into the ticket object\n        var myTicket = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<SignedAppTicket>(json);\n\n        // Check for entitlement to the SKU!\n        if (myTicket.entitlements.Any(x => x.SkuId == MY_SKU_ID))\n        {\n          Console.WriteLine("User has entitlement to your game");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n          Console.WriteLine("Not entitled");\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n}\n\npublic byte[] HexToByte(string hex)\n{\n  byte[] data = new byte[hex.Length / 2];\n  for (int i = 0; i < hex.Length; i +=2)\n  {\n    data[i / 2] = Convert.ToByte(hex.Substring(i, 2), 16);\n  }\n  return data;\n}\n```\n\n## Example: Get OAuth2 Token\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\nvar appManager = discord.GetApplicationManager();\n\n// Retrieve the token\nappManager.GetOAuth2Token((Discord.Result result, ref Discord.OAuth2Token token) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine(token.AccessToken);\n\n  // Now send that token off to your server to do your own validation!\n})\n```\n'

e.exports="# Discord\n\n> info\n> Need help with the SDK? Talk to us in the [Discord Developers Server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers)!\n\n> warn\n> Game approval submissions are currently paused due to unforeseen circumstances. We apologize for the inconvenience. [Click here for more info.](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041437171)\n\nMaking a game? Need a whole bunch of fancy APIs to help make it great and your players' lives a breeze? Look no further! The Discord GameSDK is an easy drop-in SDK to help you manage all the hard things that come with making a game. Well, all the hards things about coding it at least. Interpersonal communication skills are on you (have you heard of this cool chat app called Discord?).\n\nOK, cool, so how's it work?\n\n## General Structure\n\nAt a high level, the Discord GameSDK has a class, `Discord`. This class is in charge of the creation of a few \"manager\" sub-classes. They are:\n\n- `AchievementManager` - for achievements!\n- `ActivityManager` - for Rich Presence and game invites\n- `ApplicationManager` - for retrieving a user's OAuth2 bearer token, locale, and current game branch\n- `ImageManager` - for getting data about images on Discord, like user avatars or chat images\n- `LobbyManager` - for multiplayer lobbies\n- `NetworkManager` - for all your networking layer needs\n- `OverlayManager` - for interacting with Discord's built-in overlay\n- `RelationshipManager` - for users' social relationships across Discord, including friends list\n- `StorageManager` - for saving game data to the disk and the cloud\n- `StoreManager` - for all things entitlements and SKUs, including IAP functionality\n- `UserManager` - for fetching user data for a given id and the current user\n- `VoiceManager` - to make use of Discord's awesome voice chat\n\nEach one of these managers contain a number of methods and events used to interact with Discord in the context of the manager. For example, `RelationshipManager` has a function called `Filter()`, which lets you pare down a user's inter-Discord relationships based on a boolean condition, like being friends!\n\n## Functions in the SDK\n\nMost functions in the Discord GameSDK, uh, _function_ in a similar way. They take whatever parameters are required for the function to do its job—a user id, the requested size for an image, etc.—and a callback by means of a function pointer. That callback is fired when the function completes its work, letting you handle events without worrying about piping asynchronously-returned data to the right context.\n\nSome functions behave with a normal return behavior; e.g. `RelationshipManager.Count()` just returns the number directly. Don't worry, it's outlined in the docs.\n\nA quick example with our C# binding:\n\n```c#\nvar userManager = discord.GetUserManager();\n\n// Return via callback\nuserManager.GetUser(290926444748734465, (Discord.Result result, ref Discord.User otherUser) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine(otherUser.Username);\n    Console.WriteLine(otherUser.Id);\n  }\n});\n\n\n// Return normally\nuserManager.OnCurrentUserUpdate += () =>\n{\n    var currentUser = userManager.GetCurrentUser();\n        Console.WriteLine(currentUser.Username);\n        Console.WriteLine(currentUser.Discriminator);\n        Console.WriteLine(currentUser.Id);\n    };\n});\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nDiscord passes a number of environment variables down to the SDK. These are accessed by various methods in the SDK and can be changed for local testing by changing the value in your local environment.\n\n###### SDK Environment Variables\n\n| name                   | method                                                                                | description                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID    | [Local Testing](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/testing-locally-with-two-clients)    | the locally running instance of Discord to connect to; allows you to choose between multiple running clients |\n| DISCORD_ACCESS_TOKEN   | [ApplicationManager.GetOAuth2Token()](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_APPLICATIONS/getoauth2token)     | the connected user's bearer token                                                                            |\n| DISCORD_CURRENT_LOCALE | [ApplicationManager.GetCurrentLocale()](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_APPLICATIONS/getcurrentlocale) | the language that Discord is in for the connected user                                                       |\n| DISCORD_CURRENT_BRANCH | [ApplicationManager.GetCurrentBranch()](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_APPLICATIONS/getcurrentbranch) | the branch of the running application that the user has launched                                             |\n| DISCORD_STORAGE_PATH   | [StorageManager.GetPath()](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORAGE/getpath)                            | the path to which Discord will save files if you're using the StorageManager                                 |\n\n## Error Handling\n\nDebugging is a pain, so before we get into the meat of the SDK, we want to make sure you're prepared for when things go awry. Within the Discord core is a function called `SetLogHook()`. It takes a `level`, which is minimum level of log message you want to listen to, and a callback function:\n\n```cs\npublic void LogProblemsFunction(Discord.LogLevel level, string message)\n{\n  Console.WriteLine(\"Discord:{0} - {1}\", level, message);\n}\n\ndiscord.SetLogHook(Discord.LogLevel.Debug, LogProblemsFunction);\n```\n\nYou should begin your integration by setting up this callback to help you debug. Helpfully, if you put a breakpoint inside the callback function you register here, you'll be able to see the stack trace for errors you run into (as long as they fail synchronously). Take the guess work out of debugging, or hey, ignore any and all logging by setting a callback that does nothing. We're not here to judge.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### Result Enum\n\n| Code | value                           | description

Wave goodbye, Nelly! You monster. In C# land, this is `Dispose()`.\n\n> info\n> The C++ binding does not include a `destroy()` method, as the destructor for the Core does the work for you.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\ndiscord.Dispose();\n```\n\n## SetLogHook\n\nRegisters a logging callback function with the minimum level of message to receive. The callback function should have a signature of:\n\n```\nMyCallbackFunction(LogLevel level, string message);\n```\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name     | type     | description                                 |\n|----------|----------|---------------------------------------------|\n| level    | LogLevel | the minimum level of event to log           |\n| callback | function | the callback function to catch the messages |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\npublic void LogProblemsFunction(Discord.LogLevel level, string message)\n{\n  Console.WriteLine(\"Discord:{0} - {1}\", level, message);\n}\n\ndiscord.SetLogHook(Discord.LogLevel.Debug, LogProblemFunctions);\n```\n\n## RunCallbacks\n\nRuns all pending SDK callbacks. Put this in your game's main event loop, like `Update()` in Unity. That way, the first thing your game does is check for any new info from Discord.\n\nThis function also serves as a way to know that the local Discord client is still connected. If the user closes Discord while playing your game, `RunCallbacks()` will return/throw `Discord.Result.NotRunning`.\n\nIn C and C++, this function returns `Discord.Result`. In C#, it returns `void` and will throw `Discord.Result` error if something went wrong.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvoid Update()\n{\n  discord.RunCallbacks();\n}\n```\n\n## GetActivityManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with activities in the SDK.\n\nReturns an `ActivityManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar activityManager = discord.GetActivityManager();\n```\n\n## GetRelationshipManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with relationships in the SDK.\n\nReturns a `RelationshipManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar relationshipManager = discord.GetRelationshipManager();\n```\n\n## GetImageManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with images in the SDK.\n\nReturns an `ImageManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar imageManager = discord.GetImageManager();\n```\n\n## GetUserManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with users in the SDK.\n\nReturns an `UserManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userManager = discord.GetUserManager();\n```\n\n## GetLobbyManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with lobbies in the SDK.\n\nReturns a `LobbyManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar lobbyManager = discord.GetLobbyManager();\n```\n\n## GetNetworkManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with networking in the SDK.\n\nReturns an `NetworkManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar networkManager = discord.GetNetworkManager();\n```\n\n## GetOverlayManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with the overlay in the SDK.\n\nReturns an `OverlayManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar overlayManager = discord.GetOverlayManager();\n```\n\n## GetApplicationManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with applications in the SDK.\n\nReturns an `ApplicationManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar applicationManager = discord.GetApplicationManager();\n```\n\n## GetStorageManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with storage in the SDK.\n\nReturns a `StorageManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar storageManager = discord.GetStorageManager();\n```\n\n## GetStoreManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with SKUs and Entitlements in the SDK.\n\nReturns a `StoreManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar storeManager = discord.GetStoreManager();\n```\n\n## GetVoiceManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with voice chat in the SDK.\n\nReturns a `VoiceManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar voiceManager = discord.GetVoiceManager();\n```\n\n## GetAchievementManager\n\nFetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with achievements in the SDK.\n\nReturns an `AchievementManager`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar achievementManager = discord.GetAchievementManager();\n```\n"

We apologize for the inconvenience. [Click here for more info.](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041437171)\n\nDiscord\'s pride and joy is its voice chat. Well, ok, also its memes, but mostly the voice chat. Text and video chat are pretty great, too. And have you seen that store? Anyway.\n\nIf you want people playing your game to be able to talk with each other, this Voice manager can help you out! Note that the main functionality for voice in this SDK is not _only_ in this manager. Connecting players to a voice chat happens with [ConnectVoice](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_LOBBIES/connectvoice) in the Lobby manager, and robust voice settings work through [OpenVoiceSettings](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_OVERLAY/openvoicesettings) in the Overlay manager. The Voice manager handles a few fine-grain details like self muting/deafening, swapping between VAD/PTT voice modes, and setting a PTT key. It\'s a subset of the robust settings from the overlay call for those of you that prefer to build UI and control things from your own game.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### InputModeType Enum\n\n| name          | value |\n| ------------- | ----- |\n| VoiceActivity | 0     |\n| PushToTalk    | 1     |\n\n###### InputMode Struct\n\n| name     | type          | description                                   |\n| -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| Type     | InputModeType | set either VAD or PTT as the voice input mode |\n| Shortcut | string        | the PTT hotkey for the user                   |\n\n###### Shortcut Keys\n\nKeys can be mapped as a combination by adding a "+" between values, such as `"shift + 4"` or `"ctrl + v"`.\n\n| key type      | value                                                     |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Alphabetical  | "a", "b", "c", etc.                                       |\n| Numerical     | "1", "2", "3", etc.                                       |\n| Symbols       | "-", "+", ".", "/", etc.                                  |\n| Function Keys | "f1", "f2", "f3", etc.                                    |\n| Gamepads      | standard XInput api values - "GAMEPAD0", "GAMEPAD1", etc. |\n| Enter         | "enter"                                                   |\n| Tab           | "tab"                                                     |\n| Spacebar      | "space"                                                   |\n| Backspace     | "backspace"                                               |\n| Escape        | "esc"                                                     |\n| Meta          | "meta"                                                    |\n| Shift         | "shift"                                                   |\n| Caps Lock     | "caps lock"                                               |\n| Alt           | "alt"                                                     |\n| Control       | "ctrl"                                                    |\n| Right Shift   | "right shift"                                             |\n| Right Alt     | "right alt"                                               |\n| Right Control | "right ctrl"                                              |\n| Right Meta    | "right meta"                                              |\n| Page Up       | "page up"                                                 |\n| Page Down     | "page down"                                               |\n| Scroll Lock   | "scroll lock"                                             |\n| Print Screen  | "print screen"                                            |\n| Rewind        | "rewind"                                                  |\n| Play          | "play"                                                    |\n| Fast Forward  | "fast forward"                                            |\n| Delete        | "del"                                                     |\n| End           | "end"                                                     |\n| Insert        | "insert"                                                  |\n| Break         | "break"                                                   |\n| Home          | "home"                                                    |\n| Up Arrow      | "up"                                                      |\n| Down Arrow    | "down"                                                    |\n| Left Arrow    | "left"                                                    |\n| Right Arrow   | "right"                                                   |\n\n## GetInputMode\n\nGet the current voice input mode for the user.\n\nReturns a `Discord.InputMode`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar voiceManager = discord.GetVoiceManager();\nvar inputMode = voiceManager.GetInputMode();\nConsole.WriteLine("The current input mode is {0}.

e.exports='# Lobbies\n\n> info\n> Need help with the SDK? Talk to us in the [Discord Developers Server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers)!\n\n> warn\n> Game approval submissions are currently paused due to unforeseen circumstances. We apologize for the inconvenience. [Click here for more info.](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041437171)\n\nLooking to integrate multiplayer into your game? Lobbies are a great way to organize players into contexts to play together. This manager works hand in hand with the networking layer of our SDK to make multiplayer integrations a breeze by:\n\n- Creating, managing, and joining lobbies\n- Matchmaking users based on lobby metadata, like ELO\n- Getting and setting arbitrary metadata on lobbies and lobby members\n\nLobbies in Discord work in one of two ways. By using calls from the SDK, lobbies are effectively "owned" by the user who\'s client creates the lobby. Someone boots up the game, hits your "Create Lobby" button, and their game client calls `LobbyManager.CreateLobby()` from the Discord SDK.\n\nThere is also another way to create and "own" lobbies with which the source of truth can be your own server. These SDK functions calls map to API endpoints that are exposed in Discord\'s HTTP API. In lieu of creating and managing lobbies in the SDK, you can call those endpoints directly with a token for your application and take care of it all on some far-away, totally secure server. Let\'s go over the SDK first.\n\n## The SDK Way\n\nIn order to ensure that Discord lobbies are consistent for all players, this manager works with "transactions". A `LobbyTransaction` is needed to set lobby properties, like capacity. A `MemberTransaction` is needed to set lobby member properties, like metadata.\n\nTo update a user or a lobby, create or get a transaction for that resource, call the needed methods on it, and then pass it to the `Create()` or `Update()` methods. When passed to a `Create()` or `Update()` method, the transaction objected is consumed. So, if you want to do another `Create()` or `Update()`, you need to get a new transaction.\n\n###### Example: Creating a Lobby\n\n```cs\nvar lobbyManager = discord.GetLobbyManager();\n\n// Create the transaction\nvar txn = lobbyManager.GetLobbyCreateTransaction();\n\n// Set lobby information\ntxn.SetCapacity(6);\ntxn.SetType(Discord.LobbyType.Public);\ntxn.SetMetadata("a", "123");\n\n// Create it!\nlobbyManager.CreateLobby(txn, (Discord.Result result, ref Discord.Lobby lobby) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("lobby {0} created with secret {1}", lobby.Id, lobby.Secret);\n\n  // We want to update the capacity of the lobby\n  // So we get a new transaction for the lobby\n  var newTxn = lobbyManager.GetLobbyUpdateTransaction(lobby.id);\n  newTxn.SetCapacity(5);\n\n  lobbyManager.UpdateLobby(lobby.id, newTxn, (result) =>\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("lobby {0} updated", lobby.Id);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### LobbyType Enum\n\n| name    | value |\n|

You must be connected to the lobby you are messaging. You should use this function for message sending if you are _not_ using the built in networking layer for the lobby. If you are, you should use [SendNetworkMessage](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_LOBBIES/sendnetworkmessage) instead.\n\nThis method has a rate limit of 10 messages per 5 seconds.\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type   | description                 |\n| ------- | ------ | --------------------------- |\n| lobbyId | Int64  | lobby the member belongs to |\n| data    | byte[] | the data to send            |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.SendLobbyMessage(290926798626357250, Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("hey."), (result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Message sent successfully");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## GetSearchQuery\n\nCreates a search object to search available lobbies.\n\nReturns `Discord.LobbySearchQuery`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar search = lobbyManager.GetSearchQuery();\n```\n\n## Search\n\nSearches available lobbies based on the search criteria chosen in the `Discord.LobbySearch` member functions. Lobbies that meet the criteria are then globally filtered, and can be accessed via iteration with `LobbyCount()` and `GetLobbyId()`. The callback fires when the list of lobbies is stable and ready for iteration.\n\nYou do not necessarily need to access the filtered lobbies within the context of the result callback, but it may make it easier for the sake of asynchronous timing.\n\nReturns `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type        | description         |\n| ------ | ----------- | ------------------- |\n| search | LobbySearch | the search criteria |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar search = lobbyManger.GetSearchQuery();\nsearch.Filter("metadata.matchmaking_rating", LobbySearchComparison.GreaterThan, LobbySearchCast.Number, "455");\nsearch.Sort("metadata.matchmaking_rating", LobbySearchCast.Number, "456");\nsearch.Limit(10);\nlobbyManager.Search(search, (result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    var count = lobbyManager.LobbyCount();\n    Console.WriteLine("There are {0} lobbies that match your search criteria", count);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## LobbyCount\n\nGet the number of lobbies that match the search.\n\nReturns `Int32`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.Search(search, () =>\n{\n  var count = lobbyManager.LobbyCount();\n  Console.WriteLine("There are {0} lobbies that match your search criteria", count);\n});\n```\n\n## GetLobbyId\n\nReturns the id for the lobby at the given index.\n\nReturns `Int64`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name  | type  | description                                      |\n| ----- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| index | Int32 | the index at which to access the list of lobbies |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.Search(search, () =>\n{\n  var count = lobbyManager.LobbyCount();\n  for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)\n  {\n    var id = lobbyManager.GetLobbyId(i);\n    Console.WriteLine("Found lobby {0}", id);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## ConnectVoice\n\nConnects to the voice channel of the current lobby. When connected to voice, the user can open their Discord overlay to see a list of other users with whom they are in voice, allowing them to mute/deafen themselves as well as mute/adjust the volume of other lobby members.\n\nYou can also allow users to adjust voice settings for your game with [Overlay OpenVoiceSettings](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_OVERLAY/openvoicesettings).\n\nWhen integrating lobby voice into your game, be thoughtful about the user\'s experience. Auto-joining to voice can be jarring for users who may not be expecting it. We recommend voice always being opt-in, or at least that you provide an option for a player to choose whether or not to auto-join the voice channel of lobbies they join.\n\nReturns `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description               |\n| ------- | ----- | ------------------------- |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby to voice connect to |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.ConnectVoice(290926798626357250, (result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Voice connected!");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## DisconnectVoice\n\nDisconnects from the voice channel of a given lobby.\n\nReturns `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description                    |\n| ------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby to voice disconnect from |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.DisconnectVoice(290926798626357250, (result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Voice disconnected!");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## OnLobbyUpdate\n\nFires when a lobby is updated.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description        |\n| ------- | ----- | ------------------ |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby that updated |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.OnLobbyUpdate += (lobbyID) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("lobby successfully updated: {0}", lobbyID);\n};\n```\n\n## OnLobbyDelete\n\nFired when a lobby is deleted.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type   | description                                    |\n| ------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| lobbyId | Int64  | lobby that was deleted                         |\n| reason  | string | reason for deletion - this is a system message |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.OnLobbyDelete += (lobbyID, reason) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("lobby successfully deleted: {0} with reason: {1}", lobbyID, reason);\n};\n```\n\n## OnMemberConnect\n\nFires when a new member joins the lobby.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description           |\n| ------- | ----- | --------------------- |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby the user joined |\n| userId  | Int64 | user that joined      |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.OnMemberConnect += (lobbyID, userID) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("user {0} connected to lobby: {1}", userID, lobbyID);\n};\n```\n\n## OnMemberUpdate\n\nFires when data for a lobby member is updated.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description                   |\n| ------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby the user is a member of |\n| userId  | Int64 | user that was updated         |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.OnMemberUpdate += (lobbyID, userID) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("user {0} got updated in lobby: {1}", userID, lobbyID);\n};\n```\n\n## OnMemberDisconnect\n\nFires when a member leaves the lobby.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type  | description                    |\n| ------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |\n| lobbyId | Int64 | lobby the user was a member of |\n| userId  | Int64 | user that left                 |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.OnMemberDisconnect += (lobbyID, userID) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("user {0} disconnected from lobby: {1}", userID, lobbyID);\n};\n```\n\n## OnLobbyMessage\n\nFires when a message is sent to the lobby.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name    | type   | description                  |\n| ------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |\n| lobbyId | Int64  | lobby the message is sent to |\n| userId  | Int64  | user that sent the message   |\n| data    | byte[] | the message contents         |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.OnLobbyMessage += (lobbyID, userID, data) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("lobby message: {0}, user who sent the message: {1}, Containing: {2}", lobbyID, userID, Encoding.UTF8.GetString(data));\n};\n```\n\n## OnSpeaking\n\nFires when a user connected to voice starts or stops speaking.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name     | type  | description                                             |\n| -------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| lobbyId  | Int64 | lobby the user is connected to                          |\n| userId   | Int64 | user in voice                                           |\n| speaking | bool  | `true` == started speaking, `false` == stopped speaking |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nlobbyManager.OnSpeaking += (lobbyID, userID, speaking) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("lobby speaking: {0} {1} {2}", lobbyID, userID, speaking);\n};\n```\n\n## Connecting to Lobbies\n\nIn the preceding section, you probably noticed there are a couple different methods for connecting to a lobby: `Connect()` and `ConnectWithActivitySecret()`. Lobbies in Discord are even more useful when hooked together with Activities/Rich Presence functionality; they give you everything you need to create an awesome game invite system.\n\nIf you are creating lobbies for users in the game client, and not on a backend server, consider using `GetLobbyActivitySecret` and `ConnectWithActivitySecret()`. `GetLobbyActivitySecret()` will return you a unique secret for the lobby concatenated with the lobby\'s id. You can pipe this value directly to the `Secrets.Join` field of the `Activity` payload. Then, when a user receives the secret, their client can call `ConnectWithActivitySecret()` with just the secret; the lobby id is parsed out automatically. This saves you the effort of concatenating the secret + id together yourself and then parsing them out again. As a code example:\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\nvar lobbyManager = discord.GetLobbyManager();\nvar activityManager = discord.GetActivityManager();\n\n// Create a lobby\nvar txn = lobbyManager.GetLobbyCreateTransaction();\ntxn.SetCapacity(5);\ntxn.SetType(Discord.LobbyType.Private);\n\nlobbyManager.CreateLobby(txn, (Discord.Result result, ref Discord.Lobby lobby) =>\n{\n  // Get the special activity secret\n  var secret = lobbyManager.GetLobbyActivitySecret(lobby.id);\n\n  // Create a new activity\n  // Set the party id to the lobby id, so everyone in the lobby has the same value\n  // Set the join secret to the special activity secret\n  var activity = new Discord.Activity\n  {\n    Party =\n    {\n      Id = lobby.id,\n      Size = {\n        CurrentSize = 1,\n        MaxSize = 5\n      }\n    },\n    Secrets =\n    {\n      Join = secret\n    }\n  };\n\n  activityManager.UpdateActivity(activity, (result) =>\n  {\n    // Now, you can send chat invites, or others can ask to join\n    // When other clients receive the OnActivityJoin() event, they\'ll receive the special activity secret\n    // They can then directly call lobbyManager.ConnectLobbyWithActivitySecret() and be put into the lobby together\n  })\n});\n```\n\nIf you are creating lobbies with your own backend system (see the section below), this method may not be useful for you. In that case, you can use `Connect()` and pass the lobby id and secret as you normally would. If you\'re hooking up to Activities, just make sure you send both the lobby secret and the lobby id in the `Secrets.Join` field, so anyone who tries to join has the right data.\n\n### Example: Search for a Lobby, Connect, and Join Voice\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n\n// Search lobbies.\nvar query = lobbyManager.GetSearchQuery();\n\n// Filter by a metadata value.\nquery.Filter("metadata.ELO", Discord.LobbySearchComparison.EqualTo, Discord.LobbySearchCast.Number, "1337");\n\n// Only return 1 result max.\nquery.Limit(1);\n\nlobbyManager.Search(query, () =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("search returned {0} lobbies", lobbyManager.LobbyCount());\n\n  if (lobbyManager.LobbyCount() == 1)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("first lobby: {0}", lobbyManager.GetLobbyId(0));\n  }\n\n  // Get the id of the lobby, and connect to voice\n  var id = lobbyManager.GetLobbyId(0);\n  lobbyManager.ConnectVoice(id, (result) =>\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Connected to voice!");\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Example: Crossplayish\n\nSo, an explanation. Because the DLL that you ship with your game is a stub that calls out to the local Discord client for actual operations, the SDK does not necessarily care if the game was launched from Discord. As long as the player launching the game:\n\n1.  Has Discord installed\n2.  Has a Discord account\n3.  Has logged into Discord on their machine (whether or not Discord is open)\n\nThe SDK will function as if the game were launched from Discord and everything will work; if Discord is not currently launched, the SDK will launch it.\n\nThat means that if Player A is launching Your Amazing Game from Discord, and Player B is launching it from Other Cool But Not As Cool As Discord Game Store, as long as Player B meets the above criteria, both players can play with each other using Discord\'s lobbies + networking functions. If the SDK is not able to launch Discord for Player B—maybe they\'ve never installed/used Discord before!—you\'ll get an error saying as much. We\'re not saying what you _should_ do, but hey, wouldn\'t this make a really neat in-game touchpoint for your players to join their friends on Discord, and maybe even join your game\'s [verified server](https://discord.com/verification)?\n\nOK so this wasn\'t really a code example, but I think you get how this works.\n\n## The API Way\n\nBelow are the API endpoints and the parameters they accept. If you choose to interface directly with the Discord API, you will need a "Bot token". This is a special authorization token with which your application can access Discord\'s HTTP API. Head on over to [your app\'s dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/), and hit the big "Add a Bot User" button. From there, mutter _abra kadabra_ and reveal the token. This token is used as an authorization header against our API like so:\n\n```\ncurl -x POST -h "Authorization: Bot <your token>" https://discord.com/api/some-route/that-does-a-thing\n```\n\n> info\n> Make sure to prepend your token with "Bot"!\n\nHere are the routes; they all expect JSON bodies. Also, hey, while you\'re here. You\'ve got a bot token. You\'re looking at our API. You should check out all the other [awesome stuff](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) you can do with it!\n\n### Create Lobby\n\n`POST https://discord.com/api/v6/lobbies`\n\nCreates a new lobby.

You can then send network messages to users by their user ID, easily retrieved via lobby methods.\n\nWe take care of all the route updating for you, so you can get up and running quickly and easily. If you\'d like to see how the lower level networking functionality works, or want to try it yourself so you can tweak it to your liking, check out [Networking](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_NETWORKING/);\n\n## ConnectNetwork\n\nConnects to the networking layer for the given lobby ID.

e.exports='# Networking\n\n> info\n> Need help with the SDK? Talk to us in the [Discord Developers Server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers)!\n\n> warn\n> Game approval submissions are currently paused due to unforeseen circumstances. We apologize for the inconvenience. [Click here for more info.](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041437171)\n\nA note before starting: this documentation covers the "low layer" networking level of the Discord GameSDK. What that means is that using the network manager directly affords you the flexibility to update routes, open channels, and handle events directly emitted by the SDK. If you\'re looking for something a bit easier and faster to integrate, we recommend that you check out the networking wrapper around our lobby documentation: [Integrated Networking](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_LOBBIES/integrated-networking)\n\nNeed a networking layer? Have a networking layer! This manager handles all things packets so you can get data from player to player and make your multiplayer...work. It:\n\n- Functions as a connection-oriented, TCP-like API, but over UDP!\n- Supports "reliable" and "unreliable" connections\n  - Packets with loot in them always get there, but player positioning can be eventually consistent\n- Features P2P-like connections, but routed through Discord\'s high-end server infrastructure\n  - All the benefits of direct connections, without the IP leaks!\n- Is encrypted!\n\nAn important note to make here is that our networking layer **is not peer-to-peer**. Discord has always promised that we will not leak your IP, and we promise to keep it that way. Though it seems like you are connected directly to another user, it routes through Discord\'s servers in the middle, ensuring both security and robust networking thanks to our servers.\n\n## GetPeerId\n\nGet the networking peer ID for the current user, allowing other users to send packets to them.\n\nReturns a `UInt64`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar myPeerId = networkManager.GetPeerId();\n```\n\n## Flush\n\nFlushes the network. Run this at the end of your game\'s loop, once you\'ve finished sending all you need to send. In Unity, for example, stick this in `LateUpdate()`.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvoid LateUpdate()\n{\n  networkManager.Flush();\n}\n```\n\n## OpenChannel\n\nOpens a channel to a user with their given peer ID on the given channel number.\n\nUnreliable channels—`reliable = false`—should be used for loss-tolerant data, like player positioning in the world. Reliable channels—`reliable = true`—should be used for data that _must_ get to the user, like loot drops!\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name      | type   | description                                          |\n| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| peerId    | UInt64 | the peerId of the user to connect to                 |\n| channelId | byte   | the channel on which to connect                      |\n| reliable  | bool   | whether the channel should be unreliable or reliable |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\nvar rawPeerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\n// Metadata is stored as a string, so we need to make it an integer for OpenChannel\nvar peerId = System.Convert.ToUInt64(rawPeerId);\nnetworkManager.OpenChannel(peerId, 0, false);\n```\n\n## OpenPeer\n\nOpens a network connection to another Discord user.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type   | description                                  |\n| ------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |\n| peerId | UInt64 | the peerId of the user to connect to         |\n| route  | string | the route the user is currently broadcasting |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar userId = 53908232506183680;\nvar lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\nvar rawPeerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.peer_id");\n// Metadata is stored as a string, so we need to make it an integer for OpenChannel\nvar peerId = System.Convert.ToUInt64(rawPeerId);\nvar route = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "metadata.route");\nnetworkManager.OpenPeer(peerId, route);\n```\n\n## UpdatePeer\n\nUpdates the network connection to another Discord user.

This callback will only fire if you already have an open channel with the user sending you data. Make sure you\'re running `RunCallbacks()` in your game loop, or you\'ll never get data!\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name      | type   | description                |\n| --------- | ------ | -------------------------- |\n| peerId    | UInt64 | the peer id of the sender  |\n| channelId | byte   | the channel it was sent on |\n| data      | byte[] | the data sent              |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nnetworkManager.OnMessage += (peerId, channel, data) =>\n{\n  var stringData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(data);\n  Console.WriteLine("Message from {0}: {1}", peerId, stringData)\n}\n```\n\n## OnRouteUpdate\n\nFires when your networking route has changed. You should broadcast to other users to whom you are connected that this has changed, probably by updating your lobby member metadata for others to receive.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name  | type   | description               |\n| ----- | ------ | ------------------------- |\n| route | string | the new route to the user |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nnetworkManager.OnRouteUpdate += route =>\n{\n  var currentUser = userManager.GetCurrentUser();\n  var lobbyId = 290926798626357250;\n\n  var txn = lobbyManager.GetMemberUpdateTransaction(lobbyId, currentUser.Id);\n  txn.SetMetadata("route", route);\n  lobbyManager.UpdateMember(lobbyId, currentUser.Id, txn, (result) =>\n  {\n    // Who needs error handling anyway\n    Console.WriteLine(result);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Flush vs RunCallbacks\n\nA quick note here may be helpful for the two functions that should be called continuously in your game loop: `discord.RunCallbacks()` and `networkManager.Flush()`. `RunCallbacks()` pumps the SDK\'s event loop, sending any newly-received data down the SDK tubes to your game. For this reason, you should call it at the beginning of your game loop; that way, any new data is handled immediately by callbacks you\'ve registered. In Unity, for example, this goes in `Update()`.\n\n`Flush()` is specific to the network manager. It actually _writes_ the packets out to the stream. You should call this at the _end_ of your game loop as a way of saying "OK, I\'m done with networking stuff, go send all the stuff to people who need it". In Unity, for example, this goes in `LateUpdate()`.\n\n## Connecting to Each Other\n\nThis manager is built around the concept of routes between players, and then channels on those routes. Player A opens a route to Player B. This route will change, most commonly if the user\'s external IP address changes. As that route changes, the player will receive `OnRouteUpdate` events. They should then alert other lobby members that their route has changed by updating their lobbymetadata. Other lobby members will see those updates from the `OnLobbyMemberUpdate` event, and can call `UpdateRoute()` accordingly. A user\'s route could change frequently, so architect your system anticipating frequent route changes and updates.\n\nOnce Player A has a route open to Player B, Player A then opens a channel to Player B, and Player B does the same to Player A. Channels are the pipes down which data is actually sent. These two users can now send data back and forth to each other with `SendMessage()` and receive it with `OnMessage`.\n\nIn order to properly send and receive data between A and B, both users need to have **the same type of channel** open to each other **on the same channel number**. If A has Reliable Channel 4 open to B, B also needs Reliable Channel 4 open to A.\n\n## Example: Connecting to Another Player in a Lobby\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, (UInt64)Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n\n// Join a lobby with another user in it\n// Get their peer id, and connect to them\n\nvar networkManager = discord.GetNetworkManager();\nvar lobbyManager = discord.GetLobbyManager();\nvar userManager = discord.GetUserManager();\n\nDiscord.User currentUser;\nvar otherUserPeerId;\nvar lobbyId;\n\n// Get yourself\ncurrentUser = userManager.GetCurrentUser();\n\n// This will fire once you connect to the lobby\n// Telling you which route is yours\nnetworkManager.OnRouteUpdate += route =>\n{\n  var txn = lobbyManager.GetMemberUpdateTransaction(lobbyId, currentUser.Id);\n  txn.SetMetadata("route", route);\n  lobbyManager.UpdateMember(lobbyId, currentUser.Id, txn, (result =>\n  {\n    // Who needs error handling anyway\n    Console.WriteLine(result);\n  }))\n}\n\n// When other users get new routes, they\'ll update their metadata\n// Fetch it and update their route\nlobbyManager.OnMemberUpdate += (lobbyId, userId) =>\n{\n  var rawPeerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "peer_id");\n  // Metadata is stored as a string, so we need to make it an integer for OpenChannel\n  var peerId = System.Convert.ToUInt64(rawPeerId);\n  var newRoute = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "route");\n  lobbyManager.UpdatePeer(peerId, newRoute);\n}\n\n// Connect to lobby with an id of 12345 and a secret of "password"\n// This may occur in a generated lobby search, when a user needs to input a password to connect\nlobbyManager.ConnectLobby(12345, "password", (Discord.Result x, ref Discord.Lobby lobby) =>\n{\n  lobbyId = lobby.Id;\n\n  // Add our own peer id to our lobby member metadata\n  // So other users can get it to connect to us\n  var localPeerId = Convert.ToString(networkManager.GetPeerId());\n  var txn = lobbyManager.GetMemberUpdateTransaction(lobby.Id, currentUser.Id);\n  txn.SetMetadata("peer_id", localPeerId);\n  lobbyManager.UpdateMember(lobby.Id, currentUser.Id, txn, (result) =>\n  {\n    // Who needs error handling anyway\n    Console.WriteLine(result);\n  });\n\n  // Get the first member in the lobby, assuming someone is already there\n  var memberId = lobbyManager.GetMemberUserId(lobby.Id, 0);\n\n  // Get their peer id and route from their metadata, added previously\n  var rawPeerId = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobbyId, userId, "peer_id");\n  // Metadata is stored as a string, so we need to make it an integer for OpenChannel\n  otherUserPeerId = System.Convert.ToUInt64(rawPeerId);\n  var otherRoute = lobbyManager.GetMemberMetadataValue(lobby.Id, memberId, "route");\n\n  // Connect to them\n  networkManager.OpenPeer(otherUserPeerId, otherRoute);\n\n}\n\n// Open an unreliable channel to the user on channel 0\n// And a reliable one on channel 1\nnetworkManager.OpenChannel(otherUserPeerId, 0, false);\nnetworkManager.OpenChannel(otherUserPeerId, 1, true);\n\n// An important data packet from our game engine\nbyte[] data = GameEngine.GetImportantData();\n\n// Determine if that data is about Player Loot Drops, if so send it on reliable, if not send it on unreliable\nif (isDataAboutPlayerLootDrops(data))\n{\n  // This is important and has to get there\n  // Send over reliable channel\n  networkManager.SendMessage(otherUserPeerId, 1, data);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // This is eventually consistent data, like the player\'s position in the world\n    // It can be sent over the unreliable channel\n    networkManager.SendMessage(otherUserPeerId, 0, data);\n}\n\n// Done; ship it!\nnetworkManager.Flush();\n```\n'

This manager will help you do just that! It:\n\n- Gives you the current state of the overlay for the user\n  - Locked, enabled, unlocked, open, closed, etc.\n- Allows you to change that state\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### ActivityActionType Enum\n\n| name     | value |\n| -------- | ----- |\n| Join     | 1     |\n| Spectate | 2     |\n\n## IsEnabled\n\nCheck whether the user has the overlay enabled or disabled. If the overlay is disabled, all the functionality in this manager will still work. The calls will instead focus the Discord client and show the modal there instead.\n\nReturns a `bool`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nif (!overlaymanager.IsEnabled())\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("Overlay is not enabled. Modals will be shown in the Discord client instead");\n}\n```\n\n## IsLocked\n\nCheck if the overlay is currently locked or unlocked\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nif (overlayManager.IsLocked())\n{\n  overlayManager.SetLocked(true, (res) =>\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Input in the overlay is now accessible again");\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## SetLocked\n\nLocks or unlocks input in the overlay. Calling `SetLocked(true);` will also close any modals in the overlay or in-app from things like IAP purchase flows and disallow input.\n\nReturns `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type | description                |\n| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- |\n| locked | bool | lock or unlock the overlay |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\noverlayManager.SetLocked(true, (res) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("Overlay has been locked and modals have been closed");\n});\n```\n\n## OpenActivityInvite\n\nOpens the overlay modal for sending game invitations to users, channels, and servers. If you do not have a valid activity with all the required fields, this call will error. See [Activity Action Field Requirements](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/activity-action-field-requirements) for the fields required to have join and spectate invites function properly.\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name | type               | description                 |\n| ---- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |\n| type | ActivityActionType | what type of invite to send |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\noverlayManager.OpenActivityInvite(Discord.ActivityActionType.Join, (result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("User is now inviting others to play!");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## OpenGuildInvite\n\nOpens the overlay modal for joining a Discord guild, given its invite code. An invite code for a server may look something like `fortnite` for a verified server—the full invite being `discord.gg/fortnite`—or something like `rjEeUJq` for a non-verified server, the full invite being `discord.gg/rjEeUJq`.\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` via callback. Note that a successful `Discord.Result` response does not necessarily mean that the user has joined the guild. If you want more granular control over and knowledge about users joining your guild, you may want to look into implementing the [`guilds.join` OAuth2 scope in an authorization code grant](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant) in conjunction with the [Add Guild Members](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/add-guild-member) endpoint.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name | type   | description                |\n| ---- | ------ | -------------------------- |\n| code | string | an invite code for a guild |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\noverlayManager.OpenGuildInvite("rjEeUJq", (result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Invite was valid.");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## OpenVoiceSettings\n\nOpens the overlay widget for voice settings for the currently connected application. These settings are unique to each user within the context of your application. That means that a user can have different favorite voice settings for each of their games!\n\n![Screenshot of the Voice Settings modal for an application](game-overlay-sdk-voice-settings.png)\n\nAlso, when connected to a lobby\'s voice channel, the overlay will show a widget that allows users to locally mute, deafen, and adjust the volume of others.\n\n![Screenshot of the Voice Widget displayed in an application](game-overlay-sdk-voice-widget.png)\n\nReturns a `Discord.Result` via callback.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\noverlayManager.OpenVoiceSettings((result) =>\n{\n  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine("Overlay is open to the voice settings for your application/")\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## OnToggle\n\nFires when the overlay is locked or unlocked (a.k.a. opened or closed)\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type | description                           |\n| ------ | ---- | ------------------------------------- |\n| locked | bool | is the overlay now locked or unlocked |\n\n###### Example\n\noverlayManager.OnToggle += overlayLock =>\n{\n    Console.WriteLine("Overlay Locked: {0}", overlayLock);\n};\n\n## Example: Activate Overlay Invite Modal\n\n```cs\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(clientId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\nvar overlayManager = discord.GetOverlayManager();\n\n// Invite users to join your game\noverlayManager.OpenActivityInvite(ActivityActionType.Join, (result) =>\n{\n  Console.WriteLine("Overlay is now open!");\n})\n```\n\nAnd that invite modal looks like this!\n\n![Screenshot of an Invitation Modal in an application](game-overlay-sdk-invite.gif)\n'

Unfortunately, it won\'t help them make relationships IRL. They\'re on their own for that. It lets you:\n\n- Access a user\'s relationships\n- Filter those relationships based on a given criteria\n- Build a user\'s friends list\n\n## First Notes\n\nRelationships on Discord change often; people start and stop playing games, go online, offline, invisible, or otherwise change state. Therefore, there are some important factors to remember when working with this manager. When you are first getting a list of a user\'s relationships, before you can `Filter()`, you need to wait for the `OnRefresh` callback to fire. This is your indicator that Discord has successfully taken a snapshot of the state of all your relationships at a given moment. Now that you have this snapshot, you can `Filter()` it to build the list that you want, and then iterate over that list to do whatever your game needs to do. Use this to build your initial social graph for a user.\n\nAs relationships change, the `OnRelationshipUpdate` event will fire. You can use this to update the user\'s social graph, changing the status of the other Discord users that you chose to filter, e.g. someone is now online, or now playing the game, or no longer playing.\n\nAn example of how to do this properly is at the end of this documentation page.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### Relationship Struct\n\n| name     | type             | description                      |\n| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Type     | RelationshipType | what kind of relationship it is  |\n| User     | User             | the user the relationship is for |\n| Presence | Presence         | that user\'s current presence     |\n\n###### RelationshipType Enum\n\n| value           | description                                                                      |\n| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| None            | user has no intrinsic relationship                                               |\n| Friend          | user is a friend                                                                 |\n| Blocked         | user is blocked                                                                  |\n| PendingIncoming | user has a pending incoming friend request to connected user                     |\n| PendingOutgoing | current user has a pending outgoing friend request to user                       |\n| Implicit        | user is not friends, but interacts with current user often (frequency + recency) |\n\n###### Presence Struct\n\n| name     | type     | description                      |\n| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Status   | Status   | the user\'s current online status |\n| Activity | Activity | the user\'s current activity      |\n\n###### Status Enum\n\n| name         | value |\n| ------------ | ----- |\n| Offline      | 0     |\n| Online       | 1     |\n| Idle         | 2     |\n| DoNotDisturb | 3     |\n\n## Filter\n\nFilters a user\'s relationship list by a boolean condition.\n\nReturns `void`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nA function that takes a `Relationship` parameter.\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nrelationshipsManager.Filter(relationship =>\n{\n  return relationship.Presence.Status == Discord.Status.Online;\n});\n```\n\n## Get\n\nGet the relationship between the current user and a given user by id.\n\nReturns a `Relationship`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name   | type  | description                 |\n| ------ | ----- | --------------------------- |\n| userId | Int64 | the id of the user to fetch |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nvar friend = relationshipsManager.Get(53908232506183680);\nConsole.WriteLine("This is my friend, {0}", friend.User.Username);\n```\n\n## GetAt\n\nGet the relationship at a given index when iterating over a list of relationships.\n\nReturns a `Relationship`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n| name  | type   | description       |\n| ----- | ------ | ----------------- |\n| index | UInt32 | index in the list |\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nfor (int i = 0; i < relationshipsManager.Count(); i++)\n{\n  var r = relationshipsManager.GetAt(i);\n  Console.WriteLine("This person is {0}", r.User.Username);\n}\n```\n\n## Count\n\nGet the number of relationships that match your `Filter()`.\n\nReturns an `Int32`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nNone\n\n###### Example\n\n```cs\nfor (int i = 0; i < relationshipsManager.Count(); i++)\n{\n  var r = relationshipsManager.At(i);\n  Console.WriteLine("This person is {0}", r.User.Username);\n}\n```\n\n## OnRefresh\n\nFires at initialization when Discord has cached a snapshot of the current status of all your relationships.

Talk to us in the [Discord Developers Server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers)!\n\n> warn\n> Game approval submissions are currently paused due to unforeseen circumstances. We apologize for the inconvenience. [Click here for more info.](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041437171)\n\nWelcome to the Discord GameSDK! We're glad you made it. This SDK is here to solve all your problems, if your problems include finding an awesome SDK to help develop your game. Our SDK is like Clippy, if Clippy were built on a modern tech stack, talked less, and was an awesome game development SDK.\n\n## Step 0 - Some Notes\n\nBefore we get off to the races, a couple notes on the SDK:\n\n- All strings in the SDK are UTF8 strings\n  - Make sure you've converted properly if necessary!\n- The SDK is **_NOT_** threadsafe!\n  - Being callback-based, we thought that'd be confusing and inconsistent\n\nNow you know, and knowing is half the battle.\n\n## Step 1 - Get the Thing\n\nI know you're already convinced, so let's begin. First, get the SDK. Here it is:\n\n- [Discord Game SDK](https://dl-game-sdk.discordapp.net/2.5.6/discord_game_sdk.zip)\n\nThere's a few things in there, but let's quickly talk about what the SDK actually _is_. Inside the `lib/` folder, you'll see `x86/` and `x86_64/` that have some `.lib`, `.bundle`, and `.dll` files. These are the things you want to distribute with your game.\n\nThese files are comprised of two parts: a \"stub\", and fallback modules. What that means is that when everything is running smoothly, the DLLs will just call back to the local running Discord client to do the heavy lifting. If, however, something is wrong, like a breaking change, the files also include \"fallback\" modules that reflect the native SDK modules in Discord at the time that version of the SDK was published. TLDR - you don't need to worry about breaking changes.\n\n## Get Set Up\n\nNext, we need to set up the application for your game. An application is the base \"entity\" in Discord for your game; it's what all the builds, branches, SKUs, store pages, assets, etc. will be filed under.\n\nHead over to our [developer site](https://discord.com/developers/) and create an account/log in if you haven't yet. The first thing we're going to do is create a Team. Teams are groups of developers working together on applications; you should create a team for your organization at [https://discord.com/developers/teams](https://discord.com/developers/teams). You can invite other users to join your team and work on applications together with you.\n\nNow that your team is created, you'll want to make an application. To do so, click on \"Applications\" at the top of the page and create an application. Make sure you pick your newly-created team in the `Team` dropdown. You want your team to own the application; this unlocks store functionality! Now that your app is made, let's dive into some more setup.\n\n> warn\n> If you're integrating our SDK into an already-released game, there's a good chance that we may _already have_ an application in our database for your game! Reach out to our [Dev Support](https://dis.gd/devsupport) to learn more\n\nFirst, we'll need to set an OAuth2 redirect URL. You can add `http://127.0.0.1` in there for now; this powers some behind-the-scenes stuff you don't need to worry about.\n\nNext, copy the **Client ID** at the top of the page. This id, also referred to as an \"application id\", is your game's unique identifier across Discord. Keep it handy!\n\nWhile you're here, head to the \"OAuth2\" section of your application and add `http://127.0.0.1` as a redirect URI for your application. This will allow us to do the OAuth2 token exchange within the Discord client.\n\nNow we're gonna start coding. Didn't think we'd get there so fast, did ya? _Think again!_ The next sections are code primers for the main languages of the SDK: C#, C, and C++. They'll get you up and running with the most basic examples, and then you're off to the races.\n\n## Code Primer - Unity (Csharp)\n\n- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.\n- Copy the contents of the `lib/` folder to `Assets/Plugins` in your Unity project\n- Copy the contents of the `csharp/` folder to `Assets/Plugins/DiscordGameSDK`\n\nFrom there, you'll be able to reference functions in the DLL within your scripts. A basic example of a script can be found [in this example repo](https://github.com/msciotti/discord-game-sdk-test-apps/tree/master/cs-examples/unity-examples/Assets). In this example, we attach our `DiscordController.cs` script to the Main Camera object of the default created scene. We then instantiate the SDK with:\n\n```cs\n/*\n    Grab that Client ID from earlier\n    Discord.CreateFlags.Default will require Discord to be running for the game to work\n    If Discord is not running, it will:\n    1. Close your game\n    2. Open Discord\n    3. Attempt to re-open your game\n    Step 3 will fail when running directly from the Unity editor\n    Therefore, always keep Discord running during tests, or use Discord.CreateFlags.NoRequireDiscord\n*/\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(CLIENT_ID, (UInt64)Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n```\n\nYou're now free to use other functionality in the SDK! Make sure to call `discord.RunCallbacks()` in your main game loop; that's your `Update()` function.\n\nYou're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/Program.cs` in the SDK zip file.\n\n## Code Primer - Non-Unity Projects (Csharp)\n\n- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.\n- Create a folder in your project directory called `DiscordGameSDK` and copy the contents of the `csharp/` folder to it\n- Build your solution then place the `.dll` in the directory of the `.exe` (either x86 or x86_64 version depending on your compile platform). If you compile for Any CPU you may need to perform additional wrapping around DLL importing (like setting the DLL directory dynamically) to make sure you load the correct DLL.\n\nFrom there, you'll be able to reference functions in the DLL within your scripts. We then instantiate the SDK with:\n\n```cs\n/*\n    Grab that Client ID from earlier\n    Discord.CreateFlags.Default will require Discord to be running for the game to work\n    If Discord is not running, it will:\n    1. Close your game\n    2. Open Discord\n    3. Attempt to re-open your game\n    Step 3 may fail when running directly from your editor\n    Therefore, always keep Discord running during tests, or use Discord.CreateFlags.NoRequireDiscord\n*/\nvar discord = new Discord.Discord(CLIENT_ID, (UInt64)Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n```\n\nYou're now free to use other functionality in the SDK! Make sure to call `discord.RunCallbacks()` in your main game loop; that's your `Update()` function.\n\nYou're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/Program.cs` in the SDK zip file.\n\n## Code Primer - Unreal Engine (C)\n\nBefore jumping into the C binding, a word of caution. If you are using Unreal Engine 3, or need to support an older version of Visual Studio, you may at first see some unexpected crashes due to compile configurations. The way to fix this is to wrap the include statement for the Discord GameSDK header file like so:\n\n```c\n#pragma pack(push, 8)\n#include \"discord_game_sdk.h\"\n#pragma pack(pop)\n```\n\nThis should let you use the SDK without any further crashes. Now, on with the show!\n\n- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.\n- Copy the contents of the `lib/` folder to the best location within your project for DLLs.\n- Copy the contents of the `c/` folder to your source directory\n- It's dangerous to go alone—take this small code block with you (to start)!\n\n```c\nstruct Application {\n    struct IDiscordCore* core;\n    struct IDiscordUsers* users;\n};\n\nstruct Application app;\n// Don't forget to memset or otherwise initialize your classes!\nmemset(&app, 0, sizeof(app));\n\nstruct IDiscordCoreEvents events;\nmemset(&events, 0, sizeof(events));\n\nstruct DiscordCreateParams params;\nparams.client_id = CLIENT_ID;\nparams.flags = DiscordCreateFlags_Default;\nparams.events = &events;\nparams.event_data = &app;\n\nDiscordCreate(DISCORD_VERSION, &params, &app.core);\n```\n\n- Make sure to call `core->run_callbacks(core, 0)` in your game loop.\n\nYou're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/c/main.c` in the SDK zip file.\n\n## Code Primer - Unreal Engine 4 (Cpp)\n\nOpen up that SDK zip that you downloaded. There's a couple things in there that we care about. The first is the contents of the `cpp/` folder. These are our source files, including headers and `.cpp` file, that we'll need to reference in our build script. Second is the contents of the `lib/` folder. In this walkthrough we'll assume that we only care about win64, for ease of use.\n\nFirst, you'll want to copy the header files and `.cpp` files to a folder somewhere in your project directory. For ease of a quickstart example, you can put them right inside your `Source/your-project-name` folder; I'd put them in a containing folder called something like `discord-files/`.\n\nSecond, you'll want to copy the `.dll` and `.lib` files from the `lib/x86_64` folder of the downloaded zip. These files should be put in `your-project-name/Binaries/Win64/`. For win32, take the files from `x86/` and put them, in `your-project-name/Binaries/Win32`.\n\nNext, we need to link these files within our project so that we can reference them. If you open up your project's `.sln` file in Visual Studio, you'll find a file called `your-project-name.Build.cs`. We're going to add the following lines of code to that file:\n\n```cpp\n/*\n    ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DISCORD_FILES_DIRECTORY will look something like:\n\n    \"H:\\\\Unreal Projects\\\\gamesdktest\\\\Source\\\\gamesdktest\\\\discord-files\\\\\"\n\n    You should get this value programatically\n*/\nPublicIncludePaths.Add(ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DISCORD_FILES_DIRECTORY)\n\n/*\n    ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_LIB_FILE will look something like:\n\n    \"H:\\\\Unreal Projects\\\\gamesdktest\\\\Binaries\\\\Win64\\\\discord_game_sdk.dll.lib\"\n\n    You should get this value programatically\n*/\nPublicAdditionalLibraries.Add(ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_LIB_FILE)\n```\n\nNow that we've got our new dependencies properly linked, we can reference them in our code. In this example, we're going to make a new `Pawn` class called `MyPawn`. It will look something like this:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"MyPawn.h\"\n#include \"discord-files/discord.h\"\n\ndiscord::Core* core{};\n\nAMyPawn::AMyPawn()\n{\n \t// Set this pawn to call Tick() every frame.  You can turn this off to improve performance if you don't need it.\n\tPrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;\n}\n\n// Called when the game starts or when spawned\nvoid AMyPawn::BeginPlay()\n{\n\tSuper::BeginPlay();\n    /*\n        Grab that Client ID from earlier\n        Discord.CreateFlags.Default will require Discord to be running for the game to work\n        If Discord is not running, it will:\n        1. Close your game\n        2. Open Discord\n        3. Attempt to re-open your game\n        Step 3 will fail when running directly from the Unreal Engine editor\n        Therefore, always keep Discord running during tests, or use Discord.CreateFlags.NoRequireDiscord\n    */\n\tauto result = discord::Core::Create(461618159171141643, DiscordCreateFlags_Default, &core);\n\tdiscord::Activity activity{};\n\tactivity.SetState(\"Testing\");\n\tactivity.SetDetails(\"Fruit Loops\");\n\tcore->ActivityManager().UpdateActivity(activity, [](discord::Result result) {\n\n    });\n}\n\n// Called every frame\nvoid AMyPawn::Tick(float DeltaTime)\n{\n\tSuper::Tick(DeltaTime);\n\t::core->RunCallbacks();\n}\n\n// Called to bind functionality to input\nvoid AMyPawn::SetupPlayerInputComponent(UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)\n{\n\tSuper::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);\n}\n```\n\nMake sure you've got `core->RunCallbacks()` going every frame!\n\nYou're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/cpp/main.cpp` in the SDK zip file.\n\n## Code Primer - No Engine (Cpp)\n\nIn your project folder, you'll want to make something like a \"discord-files\" folder, for organization. In that folder, copy all the `.h` and `.cpp` files from the zip.\nYou want to include all the header and source files respectively in your project\n\n![Correct Files](cpp-files-sdk.png)\n\nIn your project settings, you'll want to include the relevant library (e.g. `discord_game_sdk.dll.lib`) as an additional dependency.\n\n![Linked Library](lib-linked-sdk.png)\n\n- From there, you should be able to `#include \"discord-files/discord.h\"`, or whatever the path to that header file is, and have access to the code.\n\n## Testing Locally with Two Clients\n\n> info\n> Value from environment variable `DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID`\n\nWhile integrating the Discord GameSDK, you will probably find yourself wanting to test functionality between two game clients locally, be it for networking, Rich Presence, etc.\n\nWe also know that getting a test build of a game on two separate machines can be both difficult and cumbersome. So, we've got a solution for you! By using system environment variables, you can tell the SDK in a certain game client to connect to a specific Discord client. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Download Discord Canary. This is our most updated build, and is good to develop against: [Windows](https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=win) - [Mac](https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=osx)\n2. Download a second Discord Build. Here's our Public Test Build: [Windows](https://discord.com/api/download/ptb?platform=win) - [Mac](https://discord.com/api/download/ptb?platform=osx)\n3. Open up two Discord clients. We recommend you develop against Discord Canary, so you can use PTB or Stable for your test account\n4. Log in with two separate users. Make sure any test account is added to the application's App Whitelist in the portal!\n\nNow, in your game code, you can tell the SDK which client to connect to via the environment variable `DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID` **before initializing the SDK**. The value of the variable corresponds to the order in which you opened the clients, so `0` would connect to the first opened client, `1` the second, etc.\n\n###### Environment Variable Example\n\n```cs\n// This machine opened Discord Canary first, and Discord PTB second\n\n// This makes the SDK connect to Canary\nSystem.Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(\"DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID\", \"0\");\nvar discord = new Discord(applicationId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n\n// This makes the SDK connect to PTB\nSystem.Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(\"DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID\", \"1\");\nvar discord = new Discord(applicationId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);\n```\n\nThis will set the environment variable only within the context of the running process, so don't worry about messing up global stuff.\n\n> danger\n> If you test with this, make sure to remove this code before pushing a production build. It will interfere with the way that Discord launches games for users.\n\n## Section Checklist\n\nThink of these like those end of section review pages from your history textbooks, but we won't give you a pop quiz. I promise. By now, you should have the following:\n\n- The SDK downloaded\n- An application created, and a Client ID you're keeping handy\n- Rich Presence enabled on that application\n- An OAuth2 redirect URL added to that application\n- The proper libraries, DLLs, and header files in the right places for your game\n- A working SDK, via the small code snippets above\n\nIf you can check all those boxes, you are doing great! You're well-equipped to venture forth into the rest of the SDK and make full use of it's myriad of functionality. So, onwards, to game development!\n\nIf you ever need help during the process, you can always reach out to us at our [Dev Support](https://dis.gd/devsupport).

Even you.\n\nDiscord\'s storage manager lets you save data mapped to a key for easy reading, writing, and deleting both synchronously and asynchronously. It\'s saved to a super special directory, the Holy Grail of file mappings, that\'s unique per Discord user — no need to worry about your little brother overwriting your save file.\n\nCreating this manager will also spawn an IO thread for async reads and writes, so unless you really want to be blocking, you don\'t need to be!\n\n## Cloud Saves\n\nIf you want to take that save data on your players\' computers and save it to those **BIG COMPUTERS** in the cloud, look no further! All you need to do is head over to your manifest config file and set the following property:\n\n```js\n{\n  "storage": {\n    "sync": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYup, that\'s it!

The Store Manager allows you to fetch a users\' entitlements, as well as being notified when a user is granted an entitlement from a purchase flow for your game.\n\n## Application Test Mode\n\nWith this new Store Manager comes a new fun toggle in the Discord app itself: Application Test Mode! While in Application Test Mode, you can freely make "purchases" of SKUs tied to your application. That means you can test buying your game, buying DLC, or going through an IAP flow without any credit card charges.\n\n> info\n> You still need to have a valid payment method on file to "purchase" SKUs in Application Test Mode; it just won\'t be charged at checkout.\n\nTo enable it, first make sure you have a payment method on file in User Settings -> Billing. Then:\n\n1.  Open up the Discord app\n2.  Click on the settings cog in the bottom left corner\n3.  Go to Appearance -> allll the way at the bottom\n4.  Toggle "Developer Mode" **on** and "Application Test Mode" **on**, and enter your application ID\n5.  Exit user settings\n\nYou should now see an orange bar across the top of your screen; this means it worked! The dropdown in the orange bar will show you all the available SKUs for that application; you can select one of them to go to its store page. You can also view your Library and see all the branches of your game automagically there waiting for you!\n\nIf for some reason the "Install" button is greyed out, please check the following:\n\n1.  Do you have a `LIVE_BUILD_ID` on that branch for this SKU? Check with `dispatch branch list <application_id>`.\n2.  Do you have a price tier set for this SKU? If not, pick one!\n\nOnce those two conditions are met, you should be good to go! Entitlements "purchased" with this mode enabled can be revoked with the `DELETE /entitlements` HTTP endpoint, documented below.\n\n## Checking DLC Entitlements\n\nIf your game has DLC, and a user has purchased that DLC, you may want to check what they should have access to when the game launches. DLC entitlements will always be returned in a `FetchEntitlements()` call, so your game can check on each startup whether or not a user should have access to a certain new zone, raid, map, etc. based on their entitlements for DLC.\n\n## Checking Consumable Entitlements\n\nThe `Discord.SkuType.Consumable` type is used for entitlements that may be "consumed" by a game\'s own server infrastructure. That is to say that if you have in-app purchases like gem bundles, skins, etc., they will be a `Consumable` SKU type.\n\nWhat that means is that your game is expected to "consume" these entitlements by doing something on your game server—giving the player a level, more coins, a skin, etc.—and then telling Discord that\'s been done by calling the `POST /entitlements/<id>/consume`, documented below. Then, Discord will mark that entitlement as `consumed` (the `consumed` field in the returned object will be set to `true`).\n\nEntitlements to consumable SKUs are intended to signal your game\'s server/service/database that the user should get something in-game, and that the entitlement should be invalidated afterwards.\n\nThe same consumable SKU _can_ be purchased multiple times, but we have some safeguards in place to protect against possible abuse. If you purchase a consumable SKU, you cannot purchase a second one until the first one has been consumed; in the context of normal IAP transactions, your game will be auto-consuming entitlements as soon as they\'re created. If some malicious folks are somehow able to generate entitlements to your SKUs, they will not be able to consume them without your token, so you\'ll be safe!\n\nNon-consumable SKUs can only be purchased once.\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### SKU Struct\n\n| name  | type     | description              |\n| ----- | -------- | ------------------------ |\n| Id    | Int64    | the unique ID of the SKU |\n| Type  | SkuType  | what sort of SKU it is   |\n| Name  | string   | the name of the SKU      |\n| Price | SkuPrice | the price of the SKU     |\n\n###### SkuType Enum\n\n| name        | value | description                                    |\n| ----------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| Application | 1     | SKU is a game                                  |\n| DLC         | 2     | SKU is a DLC                                   |\n| Consumable  | 3     | SKU is a consumable (in-app purchase)          |\n| Bundle      | 4     | SKU is a bundle (comprising the other 3 types) |\n\n###### SkuPrice Struct\n\n| name     | type   | description                       |\n| -------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |\n| Amount   | UInt32 | the amount of money the SKU costs |\n| Currency | string | the currency the amount is in     |\n\n###### Entitlement Struct\n\n| name  | type            | description                                     |\n| ----- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Id    | Int64           | the unique ID of the entitlement                |\n| Type  | EntitlementType | the kind of entitlement it is                   |\n| SkuId | Int64           | the ID of the SKU to which the user is entitled |\n\n###### EntitlementType Enum\n\n| name                | value | description                                                    |\n| ------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Purchase            | 1     | entitlement was purchased                                      |\n| PremiumSubscription | 2     | entitlement for a Discord Nitro subscription                   |\n| DeveloperGift       | 3     | entitlement was gifted by a developer                          |\n| TestModePurchase    | 4     | entitlement was purchased by a dev in application test mode    |\n| FreePurchase        | 5     | entitlement was granted when the SKU was free                  |\n| UserGift            | 6     | entitlement was gifted by another user                         |\n| PremiumPurchase     | 7     | entitlement was claimed by user for free as a Nitro Subscriber |\n\n## FetchSkus\n\nFetches the list of SKUs for the connected application, readying them for iteration.\n\n> warn\n> Only SKUs that have a price set will be fetched.

They require a token for an authorization header. This token should be the "Bot token" of your application. To get this token, go to your application in the Dev Portal. In the left sidebar, click the `Bot` navigation item. You should then click the `Add Bot` button.\n\nAfter that, you can copy the token on this page and use it in your HTTP requests. The format for the authorization header should be `Authorization: Bot <token>`.\n\nNote that parameters with a `?` after the name denote optional fields. Parameters with a `?` before their type denote nullable fields.\n\n## HTTP-Specific Data Models\n\n###### Limited Payment Data Object\n\n| name          | type   | description                          |\n| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |\n| id            | string | unique ID of the payment             |\n| currency      | string | the currency the payment was made in |\n| amount        | int    | the amount paid                      |\n| tax           | int    | the amount of tax                    |\n| tax_inclusive | bool   | whether the amount is tax-inclusive  |\n\n## Get Entitlements % GET /applications/{application.id#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/get-set-up}/entitlements\n\nGets entitlements for a given user. You can use this on your game backend to check entitlements of an arbitrary user, or perhaps in an administrative panel for your support team.\n\n###### Query Parameters\n\n| name           | type                              | description                                                                                                                    |\n| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| user_id?       | snowflake                         | the user id to look up entitlements for                                                                                        |\n| sku_ids?       | comma-delimited set of snowflakes | (optional) the list SKU ids to check entitlements for                                                                          |\n| with_payments? | bool                              | returns [limited payment data](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORE/httpspecific-data-models-limited-payment-data-object) for each entitlement |\n| before?        | snowflake                         | retrieve entitlements before this time                                                                                         |\n| after?         | snowflake                         | retrieve entitlements after this time                                                                                          |\n| limit?         | int                               | number of entitlements to return, 1-100, default 100                                                                           |\n\n###### Example\n\n```\ncurl https://discord.com/api/v6/applications/461618159171141643/entitlements?user_id=53908232506183680&sku_ids=53908232599983680&with_payments=true&limit=1 \\\n-H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \\\n-H "Accept: application/json"\n\n// Returns\n\n{\n  [\n    {\n      "user_id": "53908232506183680",\n      "sku_id": "53908232599983680",\n      "application_id": "461618159171141643",\n      "id": "53908232506183999",\n      "type": 1,\n      "payment": {\n        "id": "538491076055400999",\n        "currency": "usd",\n        "amount": 999,\n        "tax": 0,\n        "tax_inclusive": false\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Get Entitlement % GET /applications/{application.id#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/get-set-up}/entitlements/{entitlement.id#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORE/data-models-entitlement-struct}\n\nFetch an entitlement by its ID.

You should call this endpoint from your backend server just before calling [StartPurchase](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_STORE/startpurchase) for the SKU you wish to discount. The user will then see a discounted price for that SKU at time of payment.

e.exports='# Application Commands\n\nApplication commands are commands that an application can register to Discord. They provide users a first-class way of interacting directly with your application that feels deeply integrated into Discord.\n\n## Application Command Object\n\n###### Application Command Naming\n\n`CHAT_INPUT` command names and command option names must match the following regex `^[\\w-]{1,32}$` with the unicode flag set. If there is a lowercase variant of any letters used, you must use those. Characters with no lowercase variants and/or uncased letters are still allowed. `USER` and `MESSAGE` commands may be mixed case and can include spaces.\n\n###### Application Command Structure\n\n| Field               | Type                                                                                                                                           | Description                                                                                                          | Valid Types |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| id                  | snowflake                                                                                                                                      | unique id of the command                                                                                             | all         |\n| type?

You don\'t need to complete the flow, exchange for a token, or any of that.\n\nIf your application does not require a bot user within the guild for its commands to work, **you no longer need to add for the bot scope or specific permissions**.\n\n\n## Registering a Command\n\n> info\n> Commands can only be registered via HTTP endpoint.\n\nCommands can be scoped either globally or to a specific guild. Global commands are available for every guild that adds your app. An individual app\'s global commands are also available in DMs if that app has a bot that shares a mutual guild with the user.\n\nGuild commands are specific to the guild you specify when making them. Guild commands are not available in DMs. Command names are unique per application, per type, within each scope (global and guild). That means:\n\n- Your app **cannot** have two global `CHAT_INPUT` commands with the same name\n- Your app **cannot** have two guild `CHAT_INPUT` commands within the same name **on the same guild**\n- Your app **cannot** have two global `USER` commands with the same name\n- Your app **can** have a global and guild `CHAT_INPUT` command with the same name\n- Your app **can** have a global `CHAT_INPUT` and `USER` command with the same name\n- Multiple apps **can** have commands with the same names\n\nThis list is non-exhaustive. In general, remember that command names must be unique per application, per type, and within each scope (global and guild).\n\nAn app can have the following number of commands:\n\n- 100 global `CHAT_INPUT` commands\n- 5 global `USER` commands\n- 5 global `MESSAGE` commands\n\nAs well as the same amount of guild-specific commands per guild.\n\n> danger\n> There is a global rate limit of 200 application command creates per day, per guild\n\n### Making a Global Command\n\nGlobal commands are available on _all_ your app\'s guilds. Global commands are cached for **1 hour**. That means that new global commands will fan out slowly across all guilds, and will be guaranteed to be updated in an hour.\n\nGlobal commands have inherent read-repair functionality. That means that if you make an update to a global command, and a user tries to use that command before it has updated for them, Discord will do an internal version check and reject the command, and trigger a reload for that command.\n\nTo make a **global** command, make an HTTP POST call like this:\n\n```py\nimport requests\n\n\nurl = "https://discord.com/api/v8/applications/<my_application_id>/commands"\n\n# This is an example CHAT_INPUT or Slash Command, with a type of 1\njson = {\n    "name": "blep",\n    "type": 1,\n    "description": "Send a random adorable animal photo",\n    "options": [\n        {\n            "name": "animal",\n            "description": "The type of animal",\n            "type": 3,\n            "required": True,\n            "choices": [\n                {\n                    "name": "Dog",\n                    "value": "animal_dog"\n                },\n                {\n                    "name": "Cat",\n                    "value": "animal_cat"\n                },\n                {\n                    "name": "Penguin",\n                    "value": "animal_penguin"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            "name": "only_smol",\n            "description": "Whether to show only baby animals",\n            "type": 5,\n            "required": False\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n# For authorization, you can use either your bot token\nheaders = {\n    "Authorization": "Bot <my_bot_token>"\n}\n\n# or a client credentials token for your app with the applications.commands.update scope\nheaders = {\n    "Authorization": "Bearer <my_credentials_token>"\n}\n\nr = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json)\n```\n\n### Making a Guild Command\n\nGuild commands are available only within the guild specified on creation. Guild commands update **instantly**. We recommend you use guild commands for quick testing, and global commands when they\'re ready for public use.\n\nTo make a **guild** command, make a similar HTTP POST call, but scope it to a specific `guild_id`:\n\n```py\nimport requests\n\n\nurl = "https://discord.com/api/v8/applications/<my_application_id>/guilds/<guild_id>/commands"\n\n# This is an example USER command, with a type of 2\njson = {\n    "name": "High Five",\n    "type": 2\n}\n\n# For authorization, you can use either your bot token\nheaders = {\n    "Authorization": "Bot <my_bot_token>"\n}\n\n# or a client credentials token for your app with the applications.commands.update scope\nheaders = {\n    "Authorization": "Bearer <my_credentials_token>"\n}\n\nr = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json)\n```\n\n## Updating and Deleting a Command\n\nCommands can be deleted and updated by making `DELETE` and `PATCH` calls to the command endpoint. Those endpoints are\n\n- `applications/<my_application_id>/commands/<command_id>` for global commands, or\n- `applications/<my_application_id>/guilds/<guild_id>/commands/<command_id>` for guild commands\n\nBecause commands have unique names within a type and scope, we treat `POST` requests for new commands as upserts. That means **making a new command with an already-used name for your application will update the existing command**.\n\nFull documentation of endpoints can be found [here](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/endpoints).\n\n## Permissions\n\n### Application Command Permissions Object\n\n###### Guild Application Command Permissions Structure\n\nReturned when fetching the permissions for a command in a guild.\n\n| Field          | Type                                                                                                                                                                 | Description                                      |\n| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| id             | snowflake                                                                                                                                                            | the id of the command                            |\n| application_id | snowflake                                                                                                                                                            | the id of the application the command belongs to |\n| guild_id       | snowflake                                                                                                                                                            | the id of the guild                              |\n| permissions    | array of [application command permissions](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/application-command-permissions-object-application-command-permissions-structure) | the permissions for the command in the guild     |\n\n###### Application Command Permissions Structure\n\nApplication command permissions allow you to enable or disable commands for specific users or roles within a guild.\n\n| Field      | Type                                                                                                                                                      | Description                           |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| id         | snowflake                                                                                                                                                 | the id of the role or user            |\n| type       | [application command permission type](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/application-command-permissions-object-application-command-permission-type) | role or user                          |\n| permission | boolean                                                                                                                                                   | `true` to allow, `false`, to disallow |\n\n###### Application Command Permission Type\n\n| Name | Value |\n| ---- | ----- |\n| ROLE | 1     |\n| USER | 2     |\n\nNeed to keep some of your commands safe from prying eyes, or only available to the right people? Commands support permission overwrites! For both guild _and_ global commands of all types, you can enable or disable a specific user or role in a guild from using a command.\n\n> info\n> For now, if you don\'t have permission to use a command, they\'ll show up in the command picker as disabled and unusable. They will **not** be hidden.\n\nYou can also set a `default_permission` on your commands if you want them to be disabled by default when your app is added to a new guild. Setting `default_permission` to `false` will disallow _anyone_ in a guild from using the command—even Administrators and guild owners—unless a specific overwrite is configured. It will also disable the command from being usable in DMs.\n\nFor example, this command will not be usable by anyone in any guilds by default:\n\n```json\n{\n    "name": "permissions_test",\n    "description": "A test of default permissions",\n    "type": 1,\n    "default_permission": false\n}\n```\n\nTo enable it just for a moderator role:\n\n```py\nMODERATOR_ROLE_ID = "<moderator_role_id>"\nurl = "https://discord.com/api/v8/applications/<my_application_id>/guilds/<my_guild_id>/commands/<my_command_id>/permissions"\n\njson = {\n    "permissions": [\n        {\n            "id": MODERATOR_ROLE_ID,\n            "type": 1,\n            "permission": True\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nheaders = {\n    "Authorization": "Bot <my_bot_token>"\n}\n\nr = requests.put(url, headers=headers, json=json)\n```\n\n## Slash Commands\n\nSlash commands—the `CHAT_INPUT` type—are a type of application command. They\'re made up of a name, description, and a block of `options`, which you can think of like arguments to a function. The name and description help users find your command among many others, and the `options` validate user input as they fill out your command.\n\nSlash commands can also have groups and subcommands to further organize commands. More on those later.\n\n> warn\n> Slash commands can have a maximum of 4000 characters for combined name, description, and value properties for each command and its subcommands and groups\n\n\n###### Example Slash Command\n\n```json\n{\n    "name": "blep",\n    "type": 1,\n    "description": "Send a random adorable animal photo",\n    "options": [\n        {\n            "name": "animal",\n            "description": "The type of animal",\n            "type": 3,\n            "required": true,\n            "choices": [\n                {\n                    "name": "Dog",\n                    "value": "animal_dog"\n                },\n                {\n                    "name": "Cat",\n                    "value": "animal_cat"\n                },\n                {\n                    "name": "Penguin",\n                    "value": "animal_penguin"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            "name": "only_smol",\n            "description": "Whether to show only baby animals",\n            "type": 5,\n            "required": false\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhen someone uses a slash command, your application will receive an interaction:\n\n###### Example Interaction\n\n```js\n{\n    "type": 2,\n    "token": "A_UNIQUE_TOKEN",\n    "member": {\n        "user": {\n            "id": "53908232506183680",\n            "username": "Mason",\n            "avatar": "a_d5efa99b3eeaa7dd43acca82f5692432",\n            "discriminator": "1337",\n            "public_flags": 131141\n        },\n        "roles": ["539082325061836999"],\n        "premium_since": null,\n        "permissions": "2147483647",\n        "pending": false,\n        "nick": null,\n        "mute": false,\n        "joined_at": "2017-03-13T19:19:14.040000+00:00",\n        "is_pending": false,\n        "deaf": false\n    },\n    "id": "786008729715212338",\n    "guild_id": "290926798626357999",\n    "data": {\n        "options": [{\n            "name": "cardname",\n            "value": "The Gitrog Monster"\n        }],\n        "name": "cardsearch",\n        "id": "771825006014889984"\n    },\n    "channel_id": "645027906669510667"\n}\n```\n\n## Subcommands and Subcommand Groups\n\n> warn\n> Currently, subcommands and subcommand groups all appear at the top level in the command explorer. This may change in the future to include them as nested autocomplete options.\n\nFor those developers looking to make more organized and complex groups of commands, look no further than subcommands and groups.\n\n**Subcommands** organize your commands by **specifying actions within a command or group**.\n\n**Subcommand Groups** organize your **subcommands** by **grouping subcommands by similar action or resource within a command**.\n\nThese are not enforced rules. You are free to use subcommands and groups however you\'d like; it\'s just how we think about them.\n\n> danger\n> Using subcommands or subcommand groups will make your base command unusable. You can\'t send the base `/permissions` command as a valid command if you also have `/permissions add | remove` as subcommands or subcommand groups\n\nWe support nesting one level deep within a group, meaning your top level command can contain subcommand groups, and those groups can contain subcommands. **That is the only kind of nesting supported.** Here\'s some visual examples:\n\n```\nVALID\n\ncommand\n|\n|__ subcommand\n|\n|__ subcommand\n\n----\n\nVALID\n\ncommand\n|\n|__ subcommand-group\n    |\n    |__ subcommand\n|\n|__ subcommand-group\n    |\n    |__ subcommand\n\n----\n\nVALID\n\ncommand\n|\n|__ subcommand-group\n    |\n    |__ subcommand\n|\n|__ subcommand\n\n-------\n\nINVALID\n\ncommand\n|\n|__ subcommand-group\n    |\n    |__ subcommand-group\n|\n|__ subcommand-group\n    |\n    |__ subcommand-group\n\n----\n\nINVALID\n\ncommand\n|\n|__ subcommand\n    |\n    |__ subcommand-group\n|\n|__ subcommand\n    |\n    |__ subcommand-group\n```\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nLet\'s look at an example. Let\'s imagine you run a moderation bot. You want to make a `/permissions` command that can do the following:\n\n- Get the guild permissions for a user or a role\n- Get the permissions for a user or a role on a specific channel\n- Change the guild permissions for a user or a role\n- Change the permissions for a user or a role on a specific channel\n\nWe\'ll start by defining the top-level information for `/permissions`:\n\n```js\n{\n    "name": "permissions",\n    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",\n    "options": []\n}\n```\n\n![A command with no arguments. It says /permissions](command.png)\n\nNow we have a command named `permissions`. We want this command to be able to affect users and roles. Rather than making two separate commands, we can use subcommand groups. We want to use subcommand groups here because we are grouping commands on a similar resource: `user` or `role`.\n\n```js\n{\n    "name": "permissions",\n    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",\n    "options": [\n        {\n            "name": "user",\n            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user",\n            "type": 2 // 2 is type SUB_COMMAND_GROUP\n        },\n        {\n            "name": "role",\n            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a role",\n            "type": 2\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nYou\'ll notice that a command like this **will not show up** in the command explorer. That\'s because groups are effectively "folders" for commands, and we\'ve made two empty folders. So let\'s continue.\n\nNow that we\'ve effectively made `user` and `role` "folders", we want to be able to either `get` and `edit` permissions. Within the subcommand groups, we can make subcommands for `get` and `edit`:\n\n```js\n{\n    "name": "permissions",\n    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",\n    "options": [\n        {\n            "name": "user",\n            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user",\n            "type": 2, // 2 is type SUB_COMMAND_GROUP\n            "options": [\n                {\n                    "name": "get",\n                    "description": "Get permissions for a user",\n                    "type": 1 // 1 is type SUB_COMMAND\n                },\n                {\n                    "name": "edit",\n                    "description": "Edit permissions for a user",\n                    "type": 1\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            "name": "role",\n            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a role",\n            "type": 2,\n            "options": [\n                {\n                    "name": "get",\n                    "description": "Get permissions for a role",\n                    "type": 1\n                },\n                {\n                    "name": "edit",\n                    "description": "Edit permissions for a role",\n                    "type": 1\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n![A command with grouped subcommands. It says /permissions user get](command-with-groups-subcommands.png)\n\nNow, we need some arguments! If we chose `user`, we need to be able to pick a user; if we chose `role`, we need to be able to pick a role.

The JSON looks a bit complicated, but what we\'ve ended up with is a single command that can be scoped to multiple actions, and then further scoped to a particular resource, and then even _further_ scope with optional arguments. Here\'s what it looks like all put together.\n\n![A command with grouped subcommands and parameters. It says /permissions user get with arguments for a user and a channel.](command-with-groups-subcommands-parameters.png)\n\n## User Commands\n\nUser commands are application commands that appear on the context menu (right click or tap) of users. They\'re a great way to surface quick actions for your app that target users. They don\'t take any arguments, and will return the user on whom you clicked or tapped in the interaction response.\n\n> danger\n> The `description` field is not allowed when creating user commands.

It has a `type: 1` and a sub-array of `components` of other types.\n\n- You can have up to 5 Action Rows per message\n- An Action Row cannot contain another Action Row\n\n```json\n{\n    "content": "This is a message with components",\n    "components": [\n        {\n            "type": 1,\n            "components": [\n                {\n                    "type": 2,\n                    "label": "Click me!",\n                    "style": 1,\n                    "custom_id": "click_one"\n                }\n            ]\n\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Responding to a Component Interaction\n\nResponding to a user interacting with a component is the same as other interaction types, like application commands. You can simply ACK the request, send a followup message, or edit the original message to something new. Check out [Responding to An Interaction](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/responding-to-an-interaction) and [interaction response](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-response-object) for more.\n\n## Custom ID\n\nComponents, aside from Action Rows, must have a `custom_id` field. This field is defined by the developer when sending the component payload, and is returned in the interaction payload sent when a user interacts with the component. For example, if you set `custom_id: click_me` on a button, you\'ll receive an interaction containing `custom_id: click_me` when a user clicks that button.\n\n`custom_id` must be unique per component; multiple buttons on the same message must not share the same `custom_id`. This field is a string of max 100 characters, and can be used flexibly to maintain state or pass through other important data.\n\n## Buttons\n\nButtons are interactive components that render on messages. They can be clicked by users, and send an [interaction](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-object) to your app when clicked.\n\n- Buttons must be sent inside an Action Row\n- An Action Row can contain up to 5 buttons\n- An Action Row containing buttons cannot also contain a select menu\n\n### Button Object\n\n###### Button Structure\n\n| Field      | Type                                                | Description                                                                               |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| type       | integer                                             | `2` for a button                                                                          |\n| style      | integer                                             | one of [button styles](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/button-object-button-styles) |\n| label?     | string                                              | text that appears on the button, max 80 characters                                        |\n| emoji?     | partial [emoji](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object) | `name`, `id`, and `animated`                                                              |\n| custom_id? | string                                              | a developer-defined identifier for the button, max 100 characters                         |\n| url?       | string                                              | a url for link-style buttons                                                              |\n| disabled?  | boolean                                             | whether the button is disabled (default `false`)                                          |\n\nButtons come in a variety of styles to convey different types of actions.

On desktop, clicking on a select menu opens a dropdown-style UI; on mobile, tapping a select menu opens up a half-sheet with the options.\n\n![A select menu open on desktop](desktop-select.png)\n\nSelect menus support single-select and multi-select behavior, meaning you can prompt a user to choose just one item from a list, or multiple. When a user finishes making their choice by clicking out of the dropdown or closing the half-sheet, your app will receive an [interaction](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-object-interaction-structure).\n\n- Select menus must be sent inside an Action Row\n- An Action Row can contain only one select menu\n- An Action Row containing a select menu cannot also contain buttons\n\n###### Select Menu Example\n\n```json\n// This is a message\n{\n    "content": "Mason is looking for new arena partners.

You make an application in the Dev Portal, you add a bot user to it, and you copy the token. That token can be used to connect to the gateway and to make requests against our API.\n\nInteractions bring something entirely new to the table: the ability to interact with an application _without needing a bot user in the guild_. As you read through this documentation, you\'ll see that bot tokens are only referenced as a helpful alternative to doing a client credentials auth flow. Responding to interactions does not require a bot token.\n\nIn many cases, you may still need a bot user. If you need to receive gateway events, or need to interact with other parts of our API (like fetching a guild, or a channel, or updating permissions on a user), those actions are all still tied to having a bot token. However, if you don\'t need any of those things, you never have to add a bot user to your application at all.\n\nWelcome to the new world.\n\n## Receiving an Interaction\n\nWhen a user interacts with your app, your app will receive an **[Interaction](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-object)**. Your app can receive an interaction in one of two ways:\n\n- Via [Interaction Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/interaction-create) gateway event\n- Via outgoing webhook\n\nThese two methods are **mutually exclusive**; you can _only_ receive Interactions one of the two ways. The `INTERACTION_CREATE` [Gateway Event](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/interaction-create) may be handled by connected clients, while the webhook method detailed below does not require a connected client.\n\nIn your application in the Developer Portal, there is a field on the main page called "Interactions Endpoint URL". If you want to receive Interactions via outgoing webhook, you can set your URL in this field. In order for the URL to be valid, you must be prepared for two things ahead of time:\n\n> info\n> These steps are only necessary for webhook-based Interactions. It is not required for receiving them over the gateway.\n\n1. Your endpoint must be prepared to ACK a `PING` message\n2. Your endpoint must be set up to properly handle signature headers--more on that in [Security and Authorization](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/security-and-authorization)\n\nIf either of these are not complete, we will not validate your URL and it will fail to save.\n\nWhen you attempt to save a URL, we will send a `POST` request to that URL with a `PING` payload. The `PING` payload has a `type: 1`. So, to properly ACK the payload, return a `200` response with a payload of `type: 1`:\n\n```py\n@app.route(\'/\', methods=[\'POST\'])\ndef my_command():\n    if request.json["type"] == 1:\n        return jsonify({\n            "type": 1\n        })\n```\n\nYou\'ll also need to properly set up [Security and Authorization](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/security-and-authorization) on your endpoint for the URL to be accepted. Once both of those are complete and your URL has been saved, you can start receiving Interactions via webhook! At this point, your app will **no longer receive Interactions over the gateway**. If you want to receive them over the gateway again, simply delete your URL.\n\nAn [Interaction](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-object) includes metadata to aid your application in handling it as well as `data` specific to the interaction type. You can find samples for each interaction type on their respective pages:\n\n- [Slash Commands](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/slash-commands-example-interaction)\n- [User Commands](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/user-commands-example-interaction)\n- [Message Commands](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/message-commands-example-interaction)\n- [Message Components](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/component-interaction-object-sample-component-interaction)\n- [Select Menu Message Components](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/select-menu-object-select-menu-interaction)\n\nAn explanation of all the fields can be found in our [data models](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-object).\n\nNow that you\'ve gotten the data from the user, it\'s time to respond to them.\n\n## Responding to an Interaction\n\nInteractions--both receiving and responding--are webhooks under the hood. So responding to an Interaction is just like sending a webhook request!\n\nThere are a number of ways you can respond to an interaction:\n\n### Interaction Response Object\n\n###### Interaction Response Structure\n\n| Field | Type                                                                                                                                     | Description                  |\n| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| type  | [interaction callback type](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-type)           | the type of response         |\n| data? | [interaction callback data](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-data-structure) | an optional response message |\n\n###### Interaction Callback Type\n\n| Name                                 | Value | Description                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| PONG                                 | 1     | ACK a `Ping`                                                                                                  |\n| CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE          | 4     | respond to an interaction with a message                                                                      |\n| DEFERRED_CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE | 5     | ACK an interaction and edit a response later, the user sees a loading state                                   |\n| DEFERRED_UPDATE_MESSAGE\\*            | 6     | for components, ACK an interaction and edit the original message later; the user does not see a loading state |\n| UPDATE_MESSAGE\\*                     | 7     | for components, edit the message the component was attached to                                                |\n\n\\* Only valid for [component-based](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/) interactions\n\n###### Interaction Callback Data Structure\n\nNot all message fields are currently supported.\n\n| Name              | Type                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| tts?              | boolean                                                             | is the response TTS                                                                                                                        |\n| content?          | string                                                              | message content                                                                                                                            |\n| embeds?           | array of [embeds](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/embed-object)             | supports up to 10 embeds                                                                                                                   |\n| allowed_mentions? | [allowed mentions](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/allowed-mentions-object) | [allowed mentions](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/allowed-mentions-object) object                                                                 |\n| flags?            | integer                                                             | [interaction callback data flags](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-data-flags) |\n| components?       | array of [components](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/)       | message components                                                                                                                         |\n\n###### Interaction Callback Data Flags\n\n| Name      | Value  | Description                                    |\n| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| EPHEMERAL | 1 << 6 | only the user receiving the message can see it |\n\n> warn\n> While interaction responses and followups are webhooks, they respect @everyone\'s ability to ping @everyone / @here . Nonetheless if your application responds with user data, you should still use [`allowed_mentions`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/allowed-mentions-object) to filter which mentions in the content actually ping. Other differences include the ability to send named links in the message content (`[text](url)`).\n\nWhen responding to an interaction received **via webhook**, your server can simply respond to the received `POST` request. You\'ll want to respond with a `200` status code (if everything went well), as well as specifying a `type` and `data`, which is an [Interaction Response](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-response-object) object:\n\n```py\n@app.route(\'/\', methods=[\'POST\'])\ndef my_command():\n    if request.json["type"] == 1:\n        return jsonify({\n            "type": 1\n        })\n\n    else:\n        return jsonify({\n            "type": 4,\n            "data": {\n                "tts": False,\n                "content": "Congrats on sending your command!",\n                "embeds": [],\n                "allowed_mentions": { "parse": [] }\n            }\n        })\n```\n\nIf you are receiving Interactions over the gateway, you will **also need to respond via HTTP**. Responses to Interactions **are not sent as commands over the gateway**.\n\nTo respond to a gateway Interaction, make a `POST` request like this. `interaction_id` is the unique id of that individual Interaction from the received payload. `interaction_token` is the unique token for that interaction from the received payload. **This endpoint is only valid for Interactions received over the gateway. Otherwise, respond to the `POST` request to issue an initial response.**\n\n```py\nurl = "https://discord.com/api/v8/interactions/<interaction_id>/<interaction_token>/callback"\n\njson = {\n    "type": 4,\n    "data": {\n        "content": "Congrats on sending your command!"\n    }\n}\nr = requests.post(url, json=json)\n```\n\n> info\n> Interaction `tokens` are valid for **15 minutes** and can be used to send followup messages but you **must send an initial response within 3 seconds of receiving the event**.  If the 3 second deadline is exceeded, the token will be invalidated.\n\n## Followup Messages\n\nSometimes, your bot will want to send followup messages to a user after responding to an interaction. Or, you may want to edit your original response. Whether you receive Interactions over the gateway or by outgoing webhook, you can use the following endpoints to edit your initial response or send followup messages:\n\n- [`PATCH /webhooks/<application_id>/<interaction_token>/messages/@original`](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/edit-original-interaction-response) to edit your initial response to an Interaction\n- [`DELETE /webhooks/<application_id>/<interaction_token>/messages/@original`](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/delete-original-interaction-response) to delete your initial response to an Interaction\n- [`POST /webhooks/<application_id>/<interaction_token>`](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/create-followup-message) to send a new followup message\n- [`PATCH /webhooks/<application_id>/<interaction_token>/messages/<message_id>`](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/edit-followup-message) to edit a message sent with that `token`\n\n> info\n> Interactions webhooks share the same rate limit properties as normal webhooks.\n\nInteraction tokens are valid for **15 minutes**, meaning you can respond to an interaction within that amount of time.\n\n## Security and Authorization\n\n> info\n> Check out our [Community Resources](#DOCS_TOPICS_COMMUNITY_RESOURCES/interactions) for libraries to help you with security in your language of choice.\n\nThe internet is a scary place, especially for people hosting open, unauthenticated endpoints. If you are receiving Interactions via outgoing webhook, there are some security steps you **must** take before your app is eligible to receive requests.\n\nEvery Interaction is sent with the following headers:\n\n- `X-Signature-Ed25519` as a signature\n- `X-Signature-Timestamp` as a timestamp\n\nUsing your favorite security library, you **must validate the request each time you receive an [interaction](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-object)**. If the signature fails validation, respond with a `401` error code. Here\'s a couple code examples:\n\n```js\nconst nacl = require(\'tweetnacl\');\n\n// Your public key can be found on your application in the Developer Portal\nconst PUBLIC_KEY = \'APPLICATION_PUBLIC_KEY\';\n\nconst signature = req.get(\'X-Signature-Ed25519\');\nconst timestamp = req.get(\'X-Signature-Timestamp\');\nconst body = req.rawBody; // rawBody is expected to be a string, not raw bytes\n\nconst isVerified = nacl.sign.detached.verify(\n  Buffer.from(timestamp + body),\n  Buffer.from(signature, \'hex\'),\n  Buffer.from(PUBLIC_KEY, \'hex\')\n);\n\nif (!isVerified) {\n  return res.status(401).end(\'invalid request signature\');\n}\n```\n\n```py\nfrom nacl.signing import VerifyKey\nfrom nacl.exceptions import BadSignatureError\n\n# Your public key can be found on your application in the Developer Portal\nPUBLIC_KEY = \'APPLICATION_PUBLIC_KEY\'\n\nverify_key = VerifyKey(bytes.fromhex(PUBLIC_KEY))\n\nsignature = request.headers["X-Signature-Ed25519"]\ntimestamp = request.headers["X-Signature-Timestamp"]\nbody = request.data.decode("utf-8")\n\ntry:\n    verify_key.verify(f\'{timestamp}{body}\'.encode(), bytes.fromhex(signature))\nexcept BadSignatureError:\n    abort(401, \'invalid request signature\')\n```\n\nIf you are not properly validating this signature header, we will not allow you to save your interactions URL in the Dev Portal. We will also do automated, routine security checks against your endpoint, including purposefully sending you invalid signatures. If you fail the validation, we will remove your interactions URL in the future and alert you via email and System DM.\n\nWe highly recommend checking out our [Community Resources](#DOCS_TOPICS_COMMUNITY_RESOURCES/interactions) and the libraries found there. They not only provide typing for Interactions data models, but also include decorators for API frameworks like Flask and Express to make validation easy.\n\n### Endpoints\n\n> info\n> For authorization, all endpoints take either a [bot token](#DOCS_REFERENCE/authentication) or [client credentials token](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/client-credentials-grant) for your application.\n\n## Create Interaction Response % POST /interactions/{interaction.id#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction}/{interaction.token#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-object}/callback\n\nCreate a response to an Interaction from the gateway.

Functions the same as [Execute Webhook](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK/execute-webhook), but `wait` is always true, and `flags` can be set to `64` in the body to send an ephemeral message. The `thread_id` query parameter is not required (and is furthermore ignored) when using this endpoint for interaction followups.\n\n## Get Followup Message % GET /webhooks/{application.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/application-object}/{interaction.token#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}\n\nReturns a followup message for an Interaction. Functions the same as [Get Webhook Message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK/get-webhook-message).

Archived threads are generally immutable.  To send a message or add a reaction, a thread must first be unarchived.  The API will helpfully automatically unarchive a thread when sending a message in that thread.\n\nUnlike with channels, the API will only sync updates to users about threads the current user can view.  When receiving a [guild create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) payload, the API will only include active threads the current user can view.  Threads inside of private channels are completely private to the members of that private channel.  As such, when _gaining_ access to a channel the API sends a [thread list sync](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-list-sync), which includes all active threads in that channel.\n\nThreads also track membership.  Users must be added to a thread before sending messages in them.  The API will helpfully automatically add users to a thread when sending a message in that thread.\n\nGuilds have limits on the number of active threads and members per thread.  Once these are reached additional threads cannot be created or unarchived, and users cannot be added.

This allows bots to obtain real-time member data without requiring bots to store member state in memory.\n\n\\*\\*\\* The user objects in the mentions array will only have the partial `member` field present in [MESSAGE_CREATE](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) and [MESSAGE_UPDATE](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-update) events from text-based guild channels.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* Not all channel mentions in a message will appear in `mention_channels`. Only textual channels that are visible to everyone in a lurkable guild will ever be included. Only crossposted messages (via Channel Following) currently include `mention_channels` at all. If no mentions in the message meet these requirements, this field will not be sent.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* This field is only returned for messages with a `type` of `19` (REPLY) or `21` (THREAD_STARTER_MESSAGE). If the message is a reply but the `referenced_message` field is not present, the backend did not attempt to fetch the message that was being replied to, so its state is unknown. If the field exists but is null, the referenced message was deleted.\n\n###### Message Types\n\n> warn\n> Type `19` and `20` are only in API v8. In v6, they are still type `0`.  Type 21 is only in API v9.\n\n| Type                                         | Value |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| DEFAULT                                      | 0     |\n| RECIPIENT_ADD                                | 1     |\n| RECIPIENT_REMOVE                             | 2     |\n| CALL                                         | 3     |\n| CHANNEL_NAME_CHANGE                          | 4     |\n| CHANNEL_ICON_CHANGE                          | 5     |\n| CHANNEL_PINNED_MESSAGE                       | 6     |\n| GUILD_MEMBER_JOIN                            | 7     |\n| USER_PREMIUM_GUILD_SUBSCRIPTION              | 8     |\n| USER_PREMIUM_GUILD_SUBSCRIPTION_TIER_1       | 9     |\n| USER_PREMIUM_GUILD_SUBSCRIPTION_TIER_2       | 10    |\n| USER_PREMIUM_GUILD_SUBSCRIPTION_TIER_3       | 11    |\n| CHANNEL_FOLLOW_ADD                           | 12    |\n| GUILD_DISCOVERY_DISQUALIFIED                 | 14    |\n| GUILD_DISCOVERY_REQUALIFIED                  | 15    |\n| GUILD_DISCOVERY_GRACE_PERIOD_INITIAL_WARNING | 16    |\n| GUILD_DISCOVERY_GRACE_PERIOD_FINAL_WARNING   | 17    |\n| THREAD_CREATED                               | 18    |\n| REPLY                                        | 19    |\n| CHAT_INPUT_COMMAND                           | 20    |\n| THREAD_STARTER_MESSAGE                       | 21    |\n| GUILD_INVITE_REMINDER                        | 22    |\n| CONTEXT_MENU_COMMAND                         | 23    |\n\n###### Message Activity Structure\n\n| Field     | Type    | Description                                                                                                        |\n|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| type      | integer | [type of message activity](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object-message-activity-types)                          |\n| party_id? | string  | party_id from a [Rich Presence event](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_HOW_TO/updating-presence-update-presence-payload-fields) |\n\n###### Message Activity Types\n\n| Type         | Value |\n|--------------|-------|\n| JOIN         | 1     |\n| SPECTATE     | 2     |\n| LISTEN       | 3     |\n| JOIN_REQUEST | 5     |\n\n###### Message Flags\n\n| Flag                   | Value  | Description                                                                       |\n|------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CROSSPOSTED            | 1 << 0 | this message has been published to subscribed channels (via Channel Following)    |\n| IS_CROSSPOST           | 1 << 1 | this message originated from a message in another channel (via Channel Following) |\n| SUPPRESS_EMBEDS        | 1 << 2 | do not include any embeds when serializing this message                           |\n| SOURCE_MESSAGE_DELETED | 1 << 3 | the source message for this crosspost has been deleted (via Channel Following)    |\n| URGENT                 | 1 << 4 | this message came from the urgent message system                                  |\n| HAS_THREAD             | 1 << 5 | this message has an associated thread, with the same id as the message            |\n| EPHEMERAL              | 1 << 6 | this message is only visible to the user who invoked the Interaction              |\n| LOADING                | 1 << 7 | this message is an Interaction Response and the bot is "thinking"                 |\n\n###### Example Message\n\n```json\n{\n  "reactions": [\n    {\n      "count": 1,\n      "me": false,\n      "emoji": {\n        "id": null,\n        "name": "🔥"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  "attachments": [],\n  "tts": false,\n  "embeds": [],\n  "timestamp": "2017-07-11T17:27:07.299000+00:00",\n  "mention_everyone": false,\n  "id": "334385199974967042",\n  "pinned": false,\n  "edited_timestamp": null,\n  "author": {\n    "username": "Mason",\n    "discriminator": "9999",\n    "id": "53908099506183680",\n    "avatar": "a_bab14f271d565501444b2ca3be944b25"\n  },\n  "mention_roles": [],\n  "content": "Supa Hot",\n  "channel_id": "290926798999357250",\n  "mentions": [],\n  "type": 0\n}\n```\n\n###### Example Crossposted Message\n\n```json\n{\n  "reactions": [\n    {\n      "count": 1,\n      "me": false,\n      "emoji": {\n        "id": null,\n        "name": "🔥"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  "attachments": [],\n  "tts": false,\n  "embeds": [],\n  "timestamp": "2017-07-11T17:27:07.299000+00:00",\n  "mention_everyone": false,\n  "id": "334385199974967042",\n  "pinned": false,\n  "edited_timestamp": null,\n  "author": {\n    "username": "Mason",\n    "discriminator": "9999",\n    "id": "53908099506183680",\n    "avatar": "a_bab14f271d565501444b2ca3be944b25"\n  },\n  "mention_roles": [],\n  "mention_channels": [\n    {\n      "id": "278325129692446722",\n      "guild_id": "278325129692446720",\n      "name": "big-news",\n      "type": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  "content": "Big news!

Since message references are generic attribution to a previous message, there will be more types of messages which have this information in the future.\n\n###### Crosspost messages\n\n- These are messages that originated from another channel (IS_CROSSPOST flag).\n- These messages have all three fields, with data of the original message that was crossposted.\n\n###### Channel Follow Add messages\n\n- These are automatic messages sent when a channel is followed into the current channel (type 12).\n- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, with data of the followed announcement channel.\n\n###### Pin messages\n\n- These are automatic messages sent when a message is pinned (type 6).\n- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, with data of the message that was pinned.\n\n###### Replies\n\n- These are messages replying to a previous message (type 19).\n- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, with data of the message that was replied to. The channel_id and guild_id will be the same as the reply.\n- Replies are created by including a message_reference when sending a message. When sending, only `message_id` is required.\n\n###### Thread starter messsage\n\n- These are the first message in a public thread.  They point back to the message in the parent channel from which the thread was started (type 21)\n- These messages have `message_id`, `channel_id`, and `guild_id`.\n- These messages will never have content, embeds, or attachments, mainly just the `message_reference` and `referenced_message` fields.\n\n### Followed Channel Object\n\n###### Followed Channel Structure\n\n| Field      | Type      | Description               |\n|------------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| channel_id | snowflake | source channel id         |\n| webhook_id | snowflake | created target webhook id |\n\n### Reaction Object\n\n###### Reaction Structure\n\n| Field | Type                                                       | Description                                       |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| count | integer                                                    | times this emoji has been used to react           |\n| me    | boolean                                                    | whether the current user reacted using this emoji |\n| emoji | partial [emoji](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object) object | emoji information                                 |\n\n### Overwrite Object\n\nSee [permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions) for more information about the `allow` and `deny` fields.\n\n###### Overwrite Structure\n\n| Field | Type      | Description                   |\n|-------|-----------|-------------------------------|\n| id    | snowflake | role or user id               |\n| type  | int       | either 0 (role) or 1 (member) |\n| allow | string    | permission bit set            |\n| deny  | string    | permission bit set            |\n\n### Thread Metadata Object\n\nThe thread metadata object contains a number of thread-specific channel fields that are not needed by other channel types.\n\n###### Thread Metadata Structure\n\n| Field                 | Type              | Description                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| archived              | boolean           | whether the thread is archived                                                                                      |\n| auto_archive_duration | integer           | duration in minutes to automatically archive the thread after recent activity, can be set to: 60, 1440, 4320, 10080 |\n| archive_timestamp     | ISO8601 timestamp | timestamp when the thread\'s archive status was last changed, used for calculating recent activity                   |\n| locked                | boolean           | whether the thread is locked; when a thread is locked, only users with MANAGE_THREADS can unarchive it              |\n| invitable?

This corresponds with existing behavior.\n\nIn the example below we would ping @here (and also @role124 and @user123)\n\n```json\n{\n  "content": "@here Hi there from <@123>, cc <@&124>"\n}\n```\n\nTo suppress all mentions in a message use:\n\n```json\n{\n  "content": "@everyone hi there, <@&123>",\n  "allowed_mentions": {\n    "parse": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will suppress _all_ mentions in the message (no @everyone or user mention).\n\nThe `parse` field is mutually exclusive with the other fields. In the example below, we would ping users `123` and role `124`, but _not_ @everyone. Note that passing a `Falsy` value ([], null) into the "users" field does not trigger a validation error.\n\n```json\n{\n  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@&124>",\n  "allowed_mentions": {\n    "parse": ["users", "roles"],\n    "users": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the next example, we would ping @everyone, (and also users `123` and `124` if they suppressed\n@everyone mentions), but we would not ping any roles.\n\n```json\n{\n  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",\n  "allowed_mentions": {\n    "parse": ["everyone"],\n    "users": ["123", "124"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDue to possible ambiguities, not all configurations are valid. An _invalid_ configuration is as follows\n\n```json\n{\n  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",\n  "allowed_mentions": {\n    "parse": ["users"],\n    "users": ["123", "124"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBecause `parse: ["users"]` and `users: [123, 124]` are both present, we would throw a validation error.\nThis is because the conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously (they are mutually exclusive).\n\nAny entities with an ID included in the list of IDs can be mentioned. Note that the IDs of entities not present in the message\'s content will simply be ignored.\ne.g. The following example is valid, and would mention user 123, but _not_ user 125 since there is no mention of\nuser 125 in the content.\n\n```json\n{\n  "content": "<@123> Time for some memes.",\n  "allowed_mentions": {\n    "users": ["123", "125"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Embed Limits\n\nTo facilitate showing rich content, rich embeds do not follow the traditional limits of message content. However, some limits are still in place to prevent excessively large embeds. The following table describes the limits:\n\n###### Limits\n\nAll of the following limits are measured inclusively. Leading and trailing whitespace characters are not included (they are trimmed automatically).\n\n| Field                                                                      | Limit                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| title                                                                      | 256 characters                                                                       |\n| description                                                                | 4096 characters                                                                      |\n| fields                                                                     | Up to 25 [field](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/embed-object-embed-field-structure) objects |\n| [field.name](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/embed-object-embed-field-structure)   | 256 characters                                                                       |\n| [field.value](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/embed-object-embed-field-structure)  | 1024 characters                                                                      |\n| [footer.text](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/embed-object-embed-footer-structure) | 2048 characters                                                                      |\n| [author.name](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/embed-object-embed-author-structure) | 256 characters                                                                       |\n\nAdditionally, the characters in all `title`, `description`, `field.name`, `field.value`, `footer.text`, and `author.name` fields must not exceed 6000 characters in total.

Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild, or `MANAGE_THREADS` if the channel is a thread. Deleting a category does not delete its child channels; they will have their `parent_id` removed and a [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-update) Gateway event will fire for each of them. Returns a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object on success. Fires a [Channel Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-delete) Gateway event (or [Thread Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-delete) if the channel was a thread).\n\n> warn\n> Deleting a guild channel cannot be undone. Use this with caution, as it is impossible to undo this action when performed on a guild channel. In contrast, when used with a private message, it is possible to undo the action by opening a private message with the recipient again.\n\n> info\n> For Community guilds, the Rules or Guidelines channel and the Community Updates channel cannot be deleted.\n\n> info\n> This endpoint supports the `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header.\n\n## Get Channel Messages % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages\n\nReturns the messages for a channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission to be present on the current user. If the current user is missing the \'READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY\' permission in the channel then this will return no messages (since they cannot read the message history). Returns an array of [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) objects on success.\n\n> info\n> The before, after, and around keys are mutually exclusive, only one may be passed at a time.\n\n###### Query String Params\n\n| Field  | Type      | Description                              | Required | Default |\n|--------|-----------|------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| around | snowflake | get messages around this message ID      | false    | absent  |\n| before | snowflake | get messages before this message ID      | false    | absent  |\n| after  | snowflake | get messages after this message ID       | false    | absent  |\n| limit  | integer   | max number of messages to return (1-100) | false    | 50      |\n\n## Get Channel Message % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}\n\nReturns a specific message in the channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the \'READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY\' permission to be present on the current user. Returns a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object on success.\n\n## Create Message % POST /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages\n\n> warn\n> Discord may strip certain characters from message content, like invalid unicode characters or characters which cause unexpected message formatting. If you are passing user-generated strings into message content, consider sanitizing the data to prevent unexpected behavior and utilizing `allowed_mentions` to prevent unexpected mentions.\n\nPost a message to a guild text or DM channel. Returns a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object. Fires a [Message Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) Gateway event. See [message formatting](#DOCS_REFERENCE/message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.\n\n###### Limitations\n\n- When operating on a guild channel, the current user must have the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission.\n- When sending a message with `tts` (text-to-speech) set to `true`, the current user must have the `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` permission.\n- When creating a message as a reply to another message, the current user must have the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission.\n    - The referenced message must exist and cannot be a system message.\n- The maximum request size when sending a message is **8MB**\n- For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.\n- **Files can only be uploaded when using the `multipart/form-data` content type.**\n\nYou may create a message as a reply to another message. To do so, include a [`message_reference`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-reference-object-message-reference-structure) with a `message_id`. The `channel_id` and `guild_id` in the `message_reference` are optional, but will be validated if provided.\n\n> info\n> Note that when sending a message, you must provide a value for at **least one of** `content`, `embeds`, or `file`.\n\n> info\n> For a `file` attachment, the `Content-Disposition` subpart header MUST contain a `filename` parameter.\n\n> warn\n> This endpoint supports both `application/json` and `multipart/form-data` bodies. When uploading files the `multipart/form-data` content type must be used.\n> Note that in multipart form data, the `embeds` and `allowed_mentions` fields cannot be used.

For more information, refer to the [multipart/form-data spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4).\n\nThis example demonstrates usage of the endpoint *without* `payload_json`.\n\n```\n--boundary\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="content"\n\nHello, World!\n--boundary\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="tts"\n\ntrue\n--boundary--\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates usage of the endpoint *with* `payload_json` and all content fields (`content`, `embeds`, `file`) set.\n\n```\n--boundary\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="payload_json"\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  "content": "Hello, World!",\n  "embeds": [{\n    "title": "Hello, Embed!",\n    "description": "This is an embedded message."\n  }],\n  "message_reference": {\n    "message_id": "233648473390448641"\n  }\n}\n--boundary\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="myfilename.png"\nContent-Type: image/png\n\n[image bytes]\n--boundary--\n```\n\n###### Using Attachments within Embeds\n\nYou can upload attachments when creating a message and use those attachments within your embed. To do this, you will want to upload files as part of your `multipart/form-data` body. Make sure that you\'re uploading files that contain a filename, as you will need a filename to reference against.\n\n> warn\n> Only filenames with proper image extensions are supported for the time being.\n\nIn the embed object, you can then set an image to use an attachment as its url with our attachment scheme syntax: `attachment://filename.png`\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  "embeds": [{\n    "image": {\n      "url": "attachment://screenshot.png"\n    }\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n## Crosspost Message % POST /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/crosspost\n\nCrosspost a message in a News Channel to following channels. This endpoint requires the \'SEND_MESSAGES\' permission, if the current user sent the message, or additionally the \'MANAGE_MESSAGES\' permission, for all other messages, to be present for the current user.\n\nReturns a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object.\n\n## Create Reaction % PUT /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions/{emoji#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object}/@me\n\nCreate a reaction for the message. This endpoint requires the \'READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY\' permission to be present on the current user. Additionally, if nobody else has reacted to the message using this emoji, this endpoint requires the \'ADD_REACTIONS\' permission to be present on the current user. Returns a 204 empty response on success.\nThe `emoji` must be [URL Encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) or the request will fail with `10014: Unknown Emoji`. To use custom emoji, you must encode it in the format `name:id` with the emoji name and emoji id.\n\n## Delete Own Reaction % DELETE /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions/{emoji#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object}/@me\n\nDelete a reaction the current user has made for the message. Returns a 204 empty response on success.\nThe `emoji` must be [URL Encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) or the request will fail with `10014: Unknown Emoji`. To use custom emoji, you must encode it in the format `name:id` with the emoji name and emoji id.\n\n## Delete User Reaction % DELETE /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions/{emoji#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object}/{user.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object}\n\nDeletes another user\'s reaction. This endpoint requires the \'MANAGE_MESSAGES\' permission to be present on the current user. Returns a 204 empty response on success.\nThe `emoji` must be [URL Encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) or the request will fail with `10014: Unknown Emoji`. To use custom emoji, you must encode it in the format `name:id` with the emoji name and emoji id.\n\n## Get Reactions % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions/{emoji#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object}\n\nGet a list of users that reacted with this emoji. Returns an array of [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) objects on success.\nThe `emoji` must be [URL Encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) or the request will fail with `10014: Unknown Emoji`. To use custom emoji, you must encode it in the format `name:id` with the emoji name and emoji id.\n\n###### Query String Params\n\n| Field  | Type      | Description                           | Required | Default |\n|--------|-----------|---------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| after  | snowflake | get users after this user ID          | false    | absent  |\n| limit  | integer   | max number of users to return (1-100) | false    | 25      |\n\n## Delete All Reactions % DELETE /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions\n\nDeletes all reactions on a message. This endpoint requires the \'MANAGE_MESSAGES\' permission to be present on the current user. Fires a [Message Reaction Remove All](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-reaction-remove-all) Gateway event.\n\n## Delete All Reactions for Emoji % DELETE /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}/reactions/{emoji#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/emoji-object}\n\nDeletes all the reactions for a given emoji on a message. This endpoint requires the `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission to be present on the current user. Fires a [Message Reaction Remove Emoji](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-reaction-remove-emoji) Gateway event.\nThe `emoji` must be [URL Encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) or the request will fail with `10014: Unknown Emoji`. To use custom emoji, you must encode it in the format `name:id` with the emoji name and emoji id.\n\n## Edit Message % PATCH /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages/{message.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object}\n\nEdit a previously sent message. The fields `content`, `embeds`, and `flags` can be edited by the original message author. Other users can only edit `flags` and only if they have the `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission in the corresponding channel. When specifying flags, ensure to include all previously set flags/bits in addition to ones that you are modifying. Only `flags` documented in the table below may be modified by users (unsupported flag changes are currently ignored without error).\n\nWhen the `content` field is edited, the `mentions` array in the message object will be reconstructed from scratch based on the new content. The `allowed_mentions` field of the edit request controls how this happens. If there is no explicit `allowed_mentions` in the edit request, the content will be parsed with _default_ allowances, that is, without regard to whether or not an `allowed_mentions` was present in the request that originally created the message.\n\nReturns a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object. Fires a [Message Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-update) Gateway event.\n\n> info\n> For a `file` attachment, the `Content-Disposition` subpart header MUST contain a `filename` parameter.\n\n> warn\n> This endpoint supports both `application/json` and `multipart/form-data` bodies.

When the member completes the screening, [Guild Member Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-member-update) will be emitted and `pending` will be false.\n\nGiving the member a role will bypass Membership Screening as well as the guild\'s verification level, giving the member immediate access to chat. Therefore, instead of giving a role when the member joins, it is recommended to not give the role until the user is no longer `pending`.\n\n> warn\n> We are making significant changes to the Membership Screening API specifically related to getting and editing the Membership Screening object. Long story short is that it can be improved. As such, we have removed those documentation. There will **not be** any changes to how pending members work, as outlined above. That behavior will stay the same.\n\n## Create Guild % POST /guilds\n\nCreate a new guild. Returns a [guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object) object on success.

Conversely, a Stage channel is _not live_ when there is no associated stage instance.\n- **Speakers:** A participant of a Stage channel is a _speaker_ when their [voice state](#DOCS_RESOURCES_VOICE/voice-state-object)\n  is not `suppress`ed, and has no `request_to_speak_timestamp`.\n- **Moderators**: A member of the guild is a _moderator_ of a Stage channel if they have all of the following [permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions):\n  - `MANAGE_CHANNELS`\n  - `MUTE_MEMBERS`\n  - `MOVE_MEMBERS`\n- **Topic**: This is the blurb that gets shown below the channel\'s name, among other places.\n- **Public**: A Stage instance is public when it has a `privacy_level` of `PUBLIC`.

e.exports='# Users Resource\n\nUsers in Discord are generally considered the base entity. Users can spawn across the entire platform, be members of\nguilds, participate in text and voice chat, and much more. Users are separated by a distinction of "bot" vs "normal." Although they are similar, bot users are automated users that are "owned" by another user. Unlike normal users, bot users do\n_not_ have a limitation on the number of Guilds they can be a part of.\n\n## Usernames and Nicknames\n\nDiscord enforces the following restrictions for usernames and nicknames:\n\n1.  Names can contain most valid unicode characters. We limit some zero-width and non-rendering characters.\n2.  Usernames must be between 2 and 32 characters long.\n3.  Nicknames must be between 1 and 32 characters long.\n4.  Names are sanitized and trimmed of leading, trailing, and excessive internal whitespace.\n\nThe following restrictions are additionally enforced for usernames:\n\n1.

e.exports='# Rich Presence Best Practices\n\n> danger\n> The SDK that this documentation references, [Discord-RPC](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc), has been deprecated in favor of our new [Discord GameSDK](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/). Replacement functionality for the Rich Presence SDK can be found in the [Activity Manager](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/) of that SDK. This documentation can be referenced for education but does not entirely reflect the new SDK.\n\nRich Presence is a new feature from Discord that allows you to surface unique, interesting, and actionable data inside a Discord user’s profile when they play your game! This guide is intended to show some best practices on how to make that data the best it can be. It will include images and code samples; for full technical documentation, see our developer documentation.\n\nIf you take away one thing from this guide, let it be this:\n\n> warn\n> Rich Presence data should give others a clear understanding of what someone is doing so they can decide if they want to play together or not.\n\n## Who should use Rich Presence?\n\nRich Presence is a powerful way to integrate your game with Discord. To do it most effectively, you should think about its purpose and how well (or not) it matches with your game and your implementation. Rich Presence is designed for these three things:\n\n1. Show interesting, unique, actionable data in a user’s profile\n2. Allow friends to spectate each other’s games\n3. Join a friend’s in-game party or server directly from Discord\n\nWe certainly don’t want to stifle creativity, especially for games that can use Rich Presence in an interesting way. However, keep in mind that this sort of gameplay is what it was designed for, and how players will normally interact with it.\n\nIf you want to do something creative, wacky, funky, or otherwise out-there with Rich Presence for your players and aren’t sure if you can, feel free to drop us a line at [gamedevs@discord.com](mailto:gamedevs@discord.com). We’re always happy to help!\n\n## How should you think about the data you show?\n\nThe data in your players’ profiles is the first thing that others on Discord will see about your game, both those familiar with it and those who have never played. It should answer two questions: can I play with my friend right now, and if not, when can I?

e.exports="# Rich Presence FAQ\n\n> danger\n> The SDK that this documentation references, [Discord-RPC](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc), has been deprecated in favor of our new [Discord GameSDK](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/). Replacement functionality for the Rich Presence SDK can be found in the [Activity Manager](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/) of that SDK. This documentation can be referenced for education but does not entirely reflect the new SDK.\n\nBelow are answers to some common questions about integrating Rich Presence with your game. If you don't see your question answered here, feel free to reach out to [gamedevs@discord.com](mailto:gamedevs@discord.com) for more help.\n\n#### Q: I see \"Playing MyGame\", but no Rich Presence data.\n\nThere's a couple things that could be going on:\n\n- If you're running two instances of the Discord client, check both!\n- Double check that your `Discord_Initialize()` function is correct.\n\nThroughout development, make sure you have your `errored()` and `disconnected()` callbacks hooked up for debugging. You can open up the console in Discord and look for errors pertaining to `SET_ACTIVITY` for more information as well.\n\n#### Q: I'm not seeing Spectate buttons on my profile.\n\nMake sure you applied for approval! If you want the Spectate button on your players' profiles, we require your integration to go through an approval process. If you have applied and have been approved and still don't see the buttons, check your Discord console for errors.\n\n#### Q: What happens if someone has more than one game running that supports Rich Presence?\n\nDue to recent changes in our infrastructure for support of multi-activities, the behavior of multiple connected Rich Presence apps has changed from what it was before. Previously, whichever application was focused would be the presence that was shown. With the recent changes, the application that connected _first_ is now displayed.\n\nHowever, invite functionality across multiple connected applications now works no matter which app is display on a user's profile. For example, if you are hosting a Spotify listening party, playing Game A that allows you to send Join invites, and playing Game B that allows you to send Spectate invites, you'll be able to send invites to all three simultaneously!\n\n#### Q: What if someone looking at my profile or an invite doesn't own the game?\n\nAnyone can see your profile data, whether they own the game or not. They'll only be able to interact with chat invites or profile buttons if they own the game and have launched it at least once. Otherwise, the invite/button tooltip will show \"Game Not Detected\".\n\n#### Q: Do join invitations allow players to select the number of open slots?\n\nCurrently, the SDK does not support this. Party slot information is determined by the party data you sent in your presence payload.\n\n#### Q: Can I send images via the payload rather than uploading them to my Developer Dashboard?\n\nUnfortunately, the SDK does not support this feature right now. However, we hear your desires! We know that a lot of games, like customization-heavy RPGs, would benefit greatly from being able to programmatically upload assets. It may be something we tackle in the future.\n\n#### Q: Can I change something in the SDK for my own purposes?\n\nGo nuts! The SDK is open source by design. If you need or want to change something for the purposes of your specific integration—like changing our JSON parser, or changing all of the variable names to the names of your pets—go ahead and tinker to your heart's content.\n\n#### Q: OK—I've got it working! Now, how do I make my integration look _awesome_?\n\nI'm happy ~~we preempted your question~~ you asked! Check out our [Rich Presence Best Practices](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_BEST_PRACTICES/) guide for a rundown on how to make your integration the best that it can be!\n"

e.exports='# Introducing Rich Presence\n\n> danger\n> The SDK that this documentation references, [Discord-RPC](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc), has been deprecated in favor of our new [Discord GameSDK](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/). Replacement functionality for the Rich Presence SDK can be found in the [Activity Manager](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/) of that SDK. This documentation can be referenced for education but does not entirely reflect the new SDK.\n\nHow easy is it for people to play your game together? With Rich Presence from Discord, it just got so easy, a ~~caveman~~ Junior Dev could do it.\n\nIf you are testing a game integration with Rich Presence, other users will be able to see it. Please create a private test account and do not join any public servers while testing your integration.\n\n## So, what is it?\n\nRich Presence allows you to leverage the totally overhauled "Now Playing" section in a Discord user\'s profile to help people play your game together. Rich game data—including duration, score, current boss or map, and so much more—lives inside Discord. You can spectate a friend\'s game directly from their profile popout, or party up via beautiful chat embeds with real-time information about open party slots and the party\'s in-game status. No more exchanging usernames and friend codes, or wondering if there\'s room for you to join. Rich Presence is a living invitation to play together, or to watch your friends kick butt.\n\n## Step 0: Get the SDK\n\n> warn\n> Please use our new Discord GameSDK. Read the documentation and get it [here](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/).\n\n## So, how does it work?\n\nWe worked hard to make using Discord\'s Rich Presence system as easy as possible. All you need is our header file—what you will interact with—and our library—where we did all the hard work for you—and you are ready to roll!\n\nIn the header file, you\'ll find six event-emitting callbacks:\n\n1.  `ready()`\n2.  `errored()`\n3.  `disconnected()`\n4.  `joinGame()`\n5.  `spectateGame()`\n6.  `joinRequest()`\n\nThese six callbacks make up the entirety of what you need to implement. Behind the scenes, we do all the heavy lifting for you.\n\nThe header file also contains the `Discord_RunCallbacks()` function. This invokes any pending callbacks from Discord on the calling thread (it\'s thread safe!).\n\n## Initialization\n\nThe first step in implementing Rich Presence is [creating an application](https://discord.com/developers/applications/me). Once you\'ve created your application, note and save your `Client ID`. You will need this to initialize the SDK; this value will be referred to throughout this documentation as both `client_id` and `application_id`. Next, scroll down to the bottom of your application\'s page and hit the button that says "Enable Rich Presence". This will allow you to upload assets to your dashboard for later use.\n\nTo begin, you\'ll register your callback functions to the six `DiscordEventHandlers` and then call `Discord_Initialize()` with your `APPLICATION_ID`. If your game is distributed via Steam, you should also pass your application\'s Steam ID so Discord can launch your game through Steam:\n\n###### SDK Initialization Example\n\n```c\nvoid InitDiscord()\n{\n    DiscordEventHandlers handlers;\n    memset(&handlers, 0, sizeof(handlers));\n    handlers.ready = handleDiscordReady;\n    handlers.errored = handleDiscordError;\n    handlers.disconnected = handleDiscordDisconnected;\n    handlers.joinGame = handleDiscordJoinGame;\n    handlers.spectateGame = handleDiscordSpectateGame;\n    handlers.joinRequest = handleDiscordJoinRequest;\n\n    // Discord_Initialize(const char* applicationId, DiscordEventHandlers* handlers, int autoRegister, const char* optionalSteamId)\n    Discord_Initialize("418562325121990661", &handlers, 1, "1234");\n}\n```\n\nA quick breakdown on the `Discord_Initialize()` function:\n\n- `applicationId`: your client_id/application_id\n- `handlers`: the callback functions you registered for each Discord event\n- `autoRegister`: whether or not to register an application protocol for your game on the player\'s computer—necessary to launch games from Discord\n- `optionalSteamId`: your game\'s Steam application id, if your game is distributed on Steam\n\nWhen you are ready to publish your integration, we recommend digging into the source code of the SDK and copying `discord_register.h`, `discord_register_win.cpp`, `discord_register_osx.m`, and `discord_register_linux.cpp` into your installation and update process. By registering your application protocols on installation and update, your players won\'t need to run the game before being able to interact with invites, Ask to Join, and spectating in Discord.\n\n## Shutting Down\n\nDon\'t leave so soon! But when you _do_ shut down your application, don\'t forget to call `Discord_Shutdown()`. This properly terminates the thread and allows your application to shut down cleanly.\n\nIf you don\'t want to register all your event handlers at initialization, you can do so dynamically with `Discord_UpdateHandlers()`; this will allow you to register a new set of event handlers. Be mindful that this will delete old handlers if they are not explicitly bound to your handlers struct when calling this function.\n\n## Updating Presence\n\n> warn\n> Deprecated in favor of [Discord GameSDK ActivityManager.UpdateActivity()](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/updateactivity)\n\nThe core of Discord\'s Rich Presence SDK is the `Discord_UpdatePresence()` function. This is what sends your game data up to Discord to be seen and used by others. You should call `Discord_UpdatePresence()` any time something important in the presence payload changes.\n\n`Discord_UpdatePresence()` has a rate limit of one update per 15 seconds. Developers do not need to do anything to handle this rate limit. The SDK will queue up any presence updates sent in that window and send the newest one once the client is free to do so. If you are sending presence updates very frequently and wondering why you don\'t see your Discord presence changing, that\'s why!\n\n###### Update Presence Example\n\n```c\nvoid UpdatePresence()\n{\n    char buffer[256];\n    DiscordRichPresence discordPresence;\n    memset(&discordPresence, 0, sizeof(discordPresence));\n    discordPresence.state = "In a Group";\n    sprintf(buffer, "Ranked | Mode: %d", GameEngine.GetMode());\n    discordPresence.details = buffer;\n    discordPresence.endTimestamp = time(0) + 5 * 60;\n    discordPresence.largeImageKey = "canary-large";\n    discordPresence.smallImageKey = "ptb-small";\n    discordPresence.partyId = GameEngine.GetPartyId();\n    discordPresence.partySize = 1;\n    discordPresence.partyMax = 6;\n    discordPresence.matchSecret = "4b2fdce12f639de8bfa7e3591b71a0d679d7c93f";\n    discordPresence.spectateSecret = "e7eb30d2ee025ed05c71ea495f770b76454ee4e0";\n    discordPresence.instance = 1;\n    Discord_UpdatePresence(&discordPresence);\n}\n```\n\n###### Update Presence Payload\n\n```c\ntypedef struct DiscordRichPresence {\n    const char* state; /* max 128 bytes */\n    const char* details; /* max 128 bytes */\n    int64_t startTimestamp;\n    int64_t endTimestamp;\n    const char* largeImageKey; /* max 32 bytes */\n    const char* largeImageText;

This invite is tied to the player\'s party information; if their `partyId` changes, the invite will expire. If their `partySize` and `partyMax` changes, the invite will add, remove, and fill up slots dynamically.\n\nOther Discord users can click "Join" on the invitation. Their game will then launch, and the `joinGame()` callback will fire in their client with the inviting player\'s `joinSecret`. The client should reverse hash or otherwise unencrypt this secret and match the players together.\n\n### Ask to Join\n\nWhen Player B clicks the Ask to Join button on Player A\'s profile, the `joinRequest()` callback fires for Player A, sending the following data:\n\n###### Ask to Join Payload\n\n```c\ntypedef struct DiscordJoinRequest {\n    char userId[32];\n    char username[344];\n    char discriminator[8];\n    char avatar[128];\n} DiscordJoinRequest;\n```\n\n###### Ask to Join Payload Fields\n\n| parameter     | type      | description                                                                                                                         |\n| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| userId        | char[24]  | the userId of the player asking to join                                                                                             |\n| username      | char[344] | the username of the player asking to join                                                                                           |\n| discriminator | char[8]   | the discriminator of the player asking to join                                                                                      |\n| avatar\\*      | char[128] | the avatar hash of the player asking to join—see [image formatting](#DOCS_REFERENCE/image-formatting) for how to retrieve the image |\n\n> warn\n> `avatar` can be an empty string if the user has not uploaded an avatar to Discord\n\nWhen it fires, your game should surface this data with a Yes or No choice for Player A to accept whether or not they wish to play with Player B. Then, call `Discord_Respond()` with Player B\'s `userId` and the appropriate response code:\n\n###### Ask to Join Response Codes\n\n| code                 | value |\n| -------------------- | ----- |\n| DISCORD_REPLY_NO     | 0     |\n| DISCORD_REPLY_YES    | 1     |\n| DISCORD_REPLY_IGNORE | 2     |\n\nThe Ask to Join request persists for 30 seconds after the request is received, regardless of whether you have called `Discord_RunCallbacks()` within that window. Therefore, keep these two points in mind:\n\n- Ensure you call `Discord_RunCallbacks()` as frequently as possible to ensure your game client is up to date with any data from Discord\n- If the player is in a state in which they cannot interact with an Ask to Join request—like in the middle of a match—you should not send a `joinSecret` in the presence payload\n\n## Spectating\n\n> warn\n> Deprecated in favor of [Discord GameSDK ActivityManager.OnActivitySpectate](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/onactivityspectate)\n\n#### Relevant Callbacks:\n\n`spectateGame()`\n\n#### Relevant Payload Data:\n\n`spectateSecret`\n\nWhen you send the relevant payload data in the `Discord_UpdatePresence()` call, your player will gain the ability to invite a Discord chat channel to spectate their game. This invite is tied to the `matchSecret` and will expire when it changes.\n\nOther Discord users can click "Spectate" on the invitation. Their game will launch, and the `spectateGame()` callback will fire in their client with the original player\'s `spectateSecret`. The client should reverse hash or otherwise unencrypt this secret and spectate that player\'s game.\n\n## Secrets\n\nSecurity is of the utmost importance to us here at Discord, and we know it is for you, too. That\'s why we want to make sure that you properly understand `matchSecret`, `joinSecret`, and `spectateSecret` so that your game data is safe and secure over the wire.\n\nTo keep security on the up and up, Discord requires that you properly hash/encode/encrypt/put-a-padlock-on-and-swallow-the-key-but-wait-then-how-would-you-open-it your secrets.\n\nSecrets are obfuscated data of your choosing. They could be match ids, player ids, lobby ids, etc. You should send us data that someone else\'s game client would need to join or spectate their friend. If you can\'t or don\'t want to support those actions, you don\'t need to send us secrets.\n\n## Rich Presence Field Requirements\n\nAll fields in the `DiscordRichPresence` object are entirely optional. Anything you choose to omit simply won\'t be displayed; the UI will dynamically adapt from the full Rich Presence object all the way down to the basic presence view. We highly encourage you to include as many fields as you can to make your game as attractive and interactive for other players as possible. However, if you choose to be a bit more selective, here\'s a handy table for what each piece of Rich Presence requires:\n\n###### Rich Presence Field Requirements\n\n|     Field      | Custom Artwork | Spectating | Joining | Ask to Join |\n| :------------: | :------------: | :--------: | :-----: | :---------: |\n|     state      |                |            |         |             |\n|    details     |                |            |         |             |\n| startTimestamp |                |            |         |             |\n|  endTimestamp  |                |            |         |             |\n| largeImageKey  |       x        |            |         |             |\n| smallImageKey  |       x        |            |         |             |\n| largeImageText |       x        |            |         |             |\n| smallImageText |       x        |            |         |             |\n|    partyId     |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n|   partySize    |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n|    partyMax    |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n|  matchSecret   |                |            |         |             |\n|   joinSecret   |                |            |    x    |      x      |\n| spectateSecret |                |     x      |         |             |\n|    instance    |                |            |         |             |\n\n## Your New Developer Dashboard\n\nIncluded with the launch of Rich Presence is an overhaul of Discord\'s Developer Dashboard. We want to make Rich Presence as easy as possible to use. Our first step is helping you ditch your CDN. You\'re welcome.\n\nOK, well, not entirely. But! Discord _will_ host any and all artwork that you need to have the very richest of presences. Upload an image, tag it with a key—preferably one you can remember—and **bam**. It\'s ready for Rich Presence use. Head over to your [applications page](#APPLICATIONS) to check it out!\n\n> warn\n> **Asset keys are automatically normalized to lowercase**. Be mindful of this when referring to them in your code.\n\n## A note on testing and Game Detection\n\nIf you don\'t see Rich Presence data in your profile while testing, make sure you don\'t have multiple instances of Discord running—if you do, your presence might be changing in one of those!\n\nIf you\'re testing on your own, we recommend [downloading two separate release channels](https://discord.com/download) of the Discord desktop client. You can log into the stable, public test, and canary builds with separate credentials, making testing easier for a single developer.\n\n## So, what now?\n\nGet to coding! We can\'t wait to see the awesome integration you come up with. If you need some quick questions answered, look no further than our [Rich Presence FAQ](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_FAQ/). If you want to know how to make your integration the best it can be, read our [Best Practices Guide](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_BEST_PRACTICES/). If you\'re ready to release, consult our [Launch Checklist](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST/) and make sure you haven\'t missed anything!\n'

e.exports="# Rich Presence Launch Checklist\n\n> danger\n> The SDK that this documentation references, [Discord-RPC](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc), has been deprecated in favor of our new [Discord GameSDK](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_SDK_STARTER_GUIDE/). Replacement functionality for the Rich Presence SDK can be found in the [Activity Manager](#DOCS_GAME_SDK_ACTIVITIES/) of that SDK. This documentation can be referenced for education but does not entirely reflect the new SDK.\n\nReady to launch a Rich Presence integration for your game? Did you read our [Best Practices](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_BEST_PRACTICES/) guide? If so, we recommend looking over this checklist one last time to ensure that your integration is as great as it can be!\n\n> warn\n> Our precompiled libraries depend on the [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145). If you distribute your game on Steam, make sure to check that box in your common redistributable settings.\n\n#### Profile Strings\n\n- Have you made use of all available fields where appropriate?\n- Do your strings fit on their own lines without line wrapping?\n  - Did you check on the smaller profile pop out?\n- Do they clearly communicate:\n  - What the player is currently doing?\n  - If the player is in a group or playing alone?\n  - If the player is in a state where they can party up?\n\n#### Artwork\n\n- Is your artwork high resolution?\n- Are your images at least 1024x1024 pixels?\n- Is it clean, interesting, and descriptive without being too highly detailed?\n- Do you have artwork for every different state? Don't forget your default state/main menu!\n- Did you make use of tooltips and the small image where appropriate?\n\n#### Joining\n\n- Have you successfully implemented join invites for your game if applicable?\n- Does the state of the invite properly represent the party/group in-game with regards to:\n  - Size?\n  - Open slots?\n  - Discord _and_ non-Discord users in the party?\n- Are you able to post invites to Discord without any additional in-game setup or configuration?\n- Are you properly removing data from the presence payload when someone can no longer send invites?\n  - A `joinSecret` should not be sent if the player can't invite anyone!\n\n#### Spectating\n\n- Have you successfully implemented spectate invites for your game if applicable?\n- Is your game's spectate mode true spectating?\n  - We do _not_ allow using the Spectate button as a pseudo-Join button.\n- Are you properly removing data from the presence payload when someone can no longer spectate?\n  - A `spectateSecret` should not be sent if the player can't be spectated!\n"

e.exports='# Certified Devices\n\nBaked into Discord is the ability for hardware manufacturers to tell us a little more about the certified devices that are plugged into a user\'s computer. Unfortunately, no, you can\'t show that a user\'s PUBG Chicken Dinner was all thanks to the amazing TotallyRealHardware RGB Mouse and Keyboard Set Extraordinaire™, but you _can_ give them an amazing experience using your hardware with Discord!\n\n## How\'s it work?\n\nI\'m glad you asked!\n\n1. [Create an application](https://discord.com/developers/applications/me) for your hardware vendor—save the Client ID!\n2. Talk to Discord via one simple HTTP or WebSocket call\n3. Send us a [`SET_CERTIFIED_DEVICES`](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/setcertifieddevices) WebSocket payload or equivalent HTTP POST whenever the state of the device changes\n\nYup, that\'s it. You give us the real-time info about any connected devices, and we\'ll handle the rest to make sure that anyone using your device will have an awesome experience. Your device will also have a `CERTIFIED` badge in Discord\'s audio settings, and really, who doesn\'t love badges?\n\n![An example of how a certified device may be shown for an example audio input and output device](certified-device.png)\n\n## Connecting\n\n###### Query String Params\n\n| Name      | Value                | Required  |\n| --------- | -------------------- | --------- |\n| v         | `1`                  | All       |\n| client_id | your app\'s client id | All       |\n| encoding  | `json`               | WebSocket |\n\nYou can send event updates to the following URIs:\n\n###### HTTP\n\n```\nhttp://127.0.0.1:PORT/rpc?v=1&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID\n```\n\n###### WebSocket\n\n```\nws://127.0.0.1:PORT?v=1&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&encoding=json\n```\n\n`PORT` is a range of ports from `6463` to `6473`. You should iterate over these ports with your request until one returns a success response code or succeeds with a socket connection. Keep track of that port number for the rest of the session.\n\nTo keep your hardware in sync with Discord, send updates any time the hardware mute is toggled, or one of the voice features like echo cancellation is enabled or disabled by the user. This lets Discord get out of the way of your optimization when you\'re in control, or help out when you\'re not, ensuring an awesome experience for anyone using your hardware.\n\nEach time you update, send a full array of `devices`, sorted by your preferred priority. That means if you want a specific headset to be the default that Discord will attempt to use, put it first in the array.\n\n## Getting Device UUID\n\nFor each device in the `SET_CERTIFIED_DEVICES` payload, there is an `id` field. This `id` should be the Windows device\'s UUID, retrieved through the native Windows API. You\'ll get back something that looks like `{0.0.1.00000000}.{6cff2b76-44a8-46b9-b528-262ad8609d9f}`.\n\n> info\n> On macOS, the `id` will be the name of the device.\n\n###### Microphone Id

e.exports="# Community Resources\n\nDiscord has the best online community. At least, we like to think so, and this is our website, so our word is law, deal with it. Therefore it's a fact that our community is the best, and they make really awesome things that we want to share with developers to make their lives easier. From permissions calculators to embed visualizers to full libraries to interface with our API, there are so many great things that have come out of our community.\n\n## Discord Developers\n\nThe [Official Discord Developers server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers) is a developer ran, but community driven, support hub. If you need help with developing something on Discord or want official updates from the developers, this is the place to be.\n\n## Libraries\n\nThe Discord team curates the following list of officially vetted libraries that conform to our APIs standards around authentication and rate limiting. Using custom implementations or non-compliant libraries that abuse the API or cause excessive rate limits may result in a **permanent** ban.\n\nMany of these libraries are represented in the [unofficial, community-driven Discord server for developers](https://discord.gg/discord-api). There you'll find community members who can help answer questions about our API, community libraries, bot creation, and other development questions.\n\n###### Discord Libraries\n\n| Name                                                         | Language   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |\n| [orca](https://github.com/cee-studio/orca)                   | C          |\n| [Remora.Discord](https://github.com/Nihlus/Remora.Discord)   | C#         |\n| [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) | C#         |\n| [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus)       | C#         |\n| [aegis.cpp](https://github.com/zeroxs/aegis.cpp)             | C++        |\n| [D++](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP)                  | C++        |\n| [Discord++](https://github.com/DiscordPP/discordpp)          | C++        |\n| [Sleepy Discord](https://github.com/yourWaifu/sleepy-discord)| C++        |\n| [discljord](https://github.com/igjoshua/discljord)           | Clojure    |\n| [discordcr](https://github.com/shardlab/discordcr)           | Crystal    |\n| [nyxx](https://github.com/l7ssha/Nyxx)                       | Dart       |\n| [coxir](https://github.com/satom99/coxir)                    | Elixir     |\n| [Nostrum](https://github.com/Kraigie/nostrum)                | Elixir     |\n| [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)           | Go         |\n| [DisGord](https://github.com/andersfylling/disgord)          | Go         |\n| [catnip](https://github.com/mewna/catnip)                    | Java       |\n| [Discord4J](https://discord4j.com/)                          | Java       |\n| [Javacord](https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord)             | Java       |\n| [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)                | Java       |\n| [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)        | JavaScript |\n| [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris)                  | JavaScript |\n| [Discord.jl](https://github.com/Xh4H/Discord.jl)             | Julia      |\n| [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia)     | Lua        |\n| [lacord](https://github.com/Mehgugs/lacord)                  | Lua        |\n| [Dimscord](https://github.com/krisppurg/dimscord)            | Nim        |\n| [discordnim](https://github.com/Krognol/discordnim)          | Nim        |\n| [DiscordPHP](https://github.com/discord-php/DiscordPHP)      | PHP        |\n| [RestCord](https://www.restcord.com/)                        | PHP        |\n| [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)           | Python     |\n| [disco](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/disco)                | Python     |\n| [hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari)                | Python     |\n| [discordrb](https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb)           | Ruby       |\n| [discord-rs](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/discord-rs)      | Rust       |\n| [Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity)          | Rust       |\n| [Twilight](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight)          | Rust       |\n| [AckCord](https://github.com/Katrix/AckCord)                 | Scala      |\n| [Sword](https://github.com/Azoy/Sword)                       | Swift      |\n| [Detritus](https://github.com/detritusjs/client)             | TypeScript |\n| [discordeno](https://github.com/discordeno/discordeno)       | TypeScript |\n| [droff](https://github.com/tim-smart/droff)                  | TypeScript |\n| [Harmony](https://github.com/harmonyland/harmony)            | TypeScript |\n\n## Interactions\n\n[Interactions](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/) are the great, new way of making a Discord bot. The following open-source libraries provide help for the security and authentication checks that are mandatory if you are receiving Interactions via outgoing webhook. They also include some types for the Interactions data models.\n\n- Clojure\n  - [ring-discord-auth](https://github.com/JohnnyJayJay/ring-discord-auth)\n- Dart\n  - [nyxx_interactions](https://github.com/l7ssha/Nyxx)\n- Go\n  - [discord-interactions-go](https://github.com/bsdlp/discord-interactions-go)\n- Javascript\n  - [discord-interactions-js](https://github.com/discord/discord-interactions-js)\n  - [discord-slash-commands](https://github.com/MeguminSama/discord-slash-commands) and its [Deno fork](https://deno.land/x/discord_slash_commands)\n  - [slash-create](https://github.com/Snazzah/slash-create)\n- Python\n  - [discord-interactions-python](https://github.com/discord/discord-interactions-python)\n  - [discord-interactions.py](https://github.com/LiBa001/discord-interactions.py)\n  - [dispike](https://github.com/ms7m/dispike)\n  - [flask-discord-interactions](https://github.com/Breq16/flask-discord-interactions)\n- PHP\n  - [discord-interactions-php](https://github.com/discord/discord-interactions-php)\n- Other\n  - [caddy-discord-interactions-verifier](https://github.com/CarsonHoffman/caddy-discord-interactions-verifier)\n  - [Rauf's Slash Command Generator](https://rauf.wtf/slash)\n  - [Autocode Slash Command Builder](https://autocode.com/tools/discord/command-builder/)\n\n## Game SDK Tools\n\nDiscord Game SDK's lobby and networking layer shares similarities with other gaming platforms (i.e. Valve's Steamworks SDK). The following open source library provides developers a uniform interface for these shared features and can simplify developing for multiple platforms. Note: this library is tailored for Unity3D development.\n\n- [HouraiNetworking](https://github.com/HouraiTeahouse/HouraiNetworking)\n\n## Dispatch Tools\n\nUsing Discord's [Dispatch](#DOCS_DISPATCH_DISPATCH_AND_YOU) tool for game developers publishing on Discord can sometimes involve using the same long commands multiple times. The following open-source tool helps shorten these commands for you. It will also provide webhook support for when you're pushing an update.\n\n- [JohnyTheCarrot's Dispatch CLI](https://github.com/JohnyTheCarrot/droops-dispatch)\n\n## Permission Calculators\n\n[Permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions) in Discord are tricky. Luckily, we've got really smart people who love us and have made some great permissions calculators. If you're making a bot for others, and you're not sure how to properly calculate permissions or generate your [authorization URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/bot-authorization-flow), these are great tools:\n\n- [FiniteReality's Permissions Calculator](https://finitereality.github.io/permissions-calculator/?v=0)\n- [abalabahaha's Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#0)\n\n## Intent Calculators\n\n[Gateway Intents](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents) are pretty confusing at first. If you're not sure what to send in your [identify payload](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify), then these tools may be of help:\n\n- [ziad87's Intent Calculator](https://ziad87.net/intents/)\n- [Larko's Intent Calculator](https://discord-intents-calculator.vercel.app/)\n\n## Embed Visualizer\n\nWebhooks and embeds might seem like black magic. That's because they are, but let us help you demystify them a bit. This sweet embed visualizer lets you play around with JSON data and see exactly how it will look embedded in Discord. It even includes a webhook mode!\n\n- [Autocode Embed Builder](https://autocode.com/tools/discord/embed-builder/)\n\n## API Types\n\nIf you're working on a project that interacts with our API, you might find an API types module useful as it provides type inspection/completion for the Discord API.\n\n- [discord.js API Types](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types)\n"

e.exports='# Gateways\n\nGateways are Discord\'s form of real-time communication over secure WebSockets. Clients will receive events and data over the gateway they are connected to and send data over the REST API. The API for interacting with Gateways is complex and fairly unforgiving, therefore it\'s highly recommended you read _all_ of the following documentation before writing a custom implementation.\n\nThe Discord Gateway has a versioning system separate from the HTTP APIs. The documentation herein is only for the latest version in the following table, unless otherwise specified.\n\nImportant note: Not all event fields are documented, in particular, fields prefixed with an underscore are considered _internal fields_ and should not be relied on. We may change the format at any time.\n\n###### Gateway Versions\n\n| Version | Status                           |\n|---------|----------------------------------|\n| 9       | Available                        |\n| 8       | Available                        |\n| 7       | Doesn\'t look like anything to me |\n| 6       | Deprecated                       |\n| 5       | Discontinued                     |\n| 4       | Discontinued                     |\n\n## Payloads\n\n###### Gateway Payload Structure\n\n| Field | Type                    | Description                                                                             |\n|-------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| op    | integer                 | [opcode](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-gateway-opcodes) for the payload |\n| d     | ?mixed (any JSON value) | event data                                                                              |\n| s     | ?integer \\*             | sequence number, used for resuming sessions and heartbeats                              |\n| t     | ?string \\*              | the event name for this payload                                                         |\n\n\\* `s` and `t` are `null` when `op` is not `0` (Gateway Dispatch Opcode).\n\n### Sending Payloads\n\nPackets sent from the client to the Gateway API are encapsulated within a [gateway payload object](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sending-payloads-example-gateway-dispatch) and must have the proper opcode and data object set. The payload object can then be serialized in the format of choice (see [ETF/JSON](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/etfjson)), and sent over the websocket. Payloads to the gateway are limited to a maximum of 4096 bytes sent, going over this will cause a connection termination with error code 4002.\n\n###### Example Gateway Dispatch\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 0,\n  "d": {},\n  "s": 42,\n  "t": "GATEWAY_EVENT_NAME"\n}\n```\n\n### Receiving Payloads\n\nReceiving payloads with the Gateway API is slightly more complex than sending. When using the JSON encoding with [Payload Compression](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/payload-compression) enabled, the Gateway has the option of sending payloads as compressed JSON binaries using zlib, meaning your library _must_ detect (see [RFC1950 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950#section-2.2)) and decompress these payloads before attempting to parse them. Otherwise the gateway does implement a shared compression context between messages sent, see [Transport Compression](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/transport-compression).\n\n## Encoding and Compression\n\n#### ETF/JSON\n\nWhen initially creating and handshaking connections to the Gateway, a user can choose whether they wish to communicate over plain-text JSON or binary [ETF](https://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html).\n\n##### Using ETF\n\nWhile using ETF there are some additional constraints to note:\n\n- Snowflake IDs are transmitted as 64-bit integers over ETF.\n- The client must not send compressed messages to the server.\n- Payloads must use string keys, atom keys will lead to a 4002 decode error.\n\nSee [erlpack](https://github.com/discord/erlpack) for an ETF implementation example.\n\n#### Payload Compression\n\nWhen using JSON encoding with payload compression enabled (`compress: true` in identify), the Gateway may optionally send zlib-compressed payloads (see [RFC1950 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950#section-2.2)). Your library _must_ detect and decompress these payloads to plain-text JSON before attempting to parse them. If you are using payload compression, the gateway does not implement a shared compression context between messages sent. Payload compression will be disabled if you use transport compression (see below).\n\n#### Transport Compression\n\nCurrently the only available transport compression option is `zlib-stream`. You will need to run all received packets through a shared zlib context, as seen in the example below. Every connection to the gateway should use its own unique zlib context.\n\n###### Transport Compression Example\n\n```python\n# Z_SYNC_FLUSH suffix\nZLIB_SUFFIX = b\'\\x00\\x00\\xff\\xff\'\n# initialize a buffer to store chunks\nbuffer = bytearray()\n# create a zlib inflation context to run chunks through\ninflator = zlib.decompressobj()\n\n# ...\ndef on_websocket_message(msg):\n  # always push the message data to your cache\n  buffer.extend(msg)\n\n  # check if the last four bytes are equal to ZLIB_SUFFIX\n  if len(msg) < 4 or msg[-4:] != ZLIB_SUFFIX:\n    return\n\n  # if the message *does* end with ZLIB_SUFFIX,\n  # get the full message by decompressing the buffers\n  # NOTE: the message is utf-8 encoded.\n  msg = inflator.decompress(buffer)\n  buffer = bytearray()\n\n  # here you can treat `msg` as either JSON or ETF encoded,\n  # depending on your `encoding` param\n```\n\n## Connecting to the Gateway\n\n### Connecting\n\n###### Gateway URL Query String Params\n\n| Field     | Type    | Description                                   | Accepted Values                                                            |\n|-----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| v         | integer | Gateway Version to use                        | see [Gateway versions](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways-gateway-versions) |\n| encoding  | string  | The encoding of received gateway packets      | \'json\' or \'etf\'                                                            |\n| compress? | string  | The (optional) compression of gateway packets | \'zlib-stream\'                                                              |\n\nThe first step in establishing connectivity to the gateway is requesting a valid websocket endpoint from the API. This can be done through either the [Get Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway) or the [Get Gateway Bot](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway-bot) endpoint.\n\nWith the resulting payload, you can now open a websocket connection to the "url" (or endpoint) specified. Generally, it is a good idea to explicitly pass the gateway version and encoding. For example, we may connect to `wss://gateway.discord.gg/?v=9&encoding=json`.\n\nOnce connected, the client should immediately receive an [Opcode 10 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/hello) payload, with information on the connection\'s heartbeat interval:\n\n###### Example Gateway Hello\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 10,\n  "d": {\n    "heartbeat_interval": 45000\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Heartbeating\n\nAfter receiving [Opcode 10 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/hello), the client may begin sending [Opcode 1 Heartbeat](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/heartbeat) payloads after `heartbeat_interval * random.random()` milliseconds, and every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds thereafter. You may send heartbeats before this interval elapses, but you should avoid doing so unless necessary. There is already tolerance in the `heartbeat_interval` that will cover network latency, so you do not need to account for it in your own implementation - waiting the precise interval will suffice.\n\nThe gateway may request a heartbeat from the client in some situations by sending an [Opcode 1 Heartbeat](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/heartbeat). When this occurs, the client should immediately send an [Opcode 1 Heartbeat](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/heartbeat) without waiting the remainder of the current interval.\n\nAny time the client sends a heartbeat, the gateway will respond with [Opcode 11 Heartbeat ACK](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/heartbeating-example-gateway-heartbeat-ack), a successful *acknowledgement* of their last heartbeat:\n\n###### Example Gateway Heartbeat ACK\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 11\n}\n```\n\nIf a client does not receive a heartbeat ack between its attempts at sending heartbeats, this may be due to a failed or "zombied" connection. The client should then immediately terminate the connection with a non-1000 close code, reconnect, and attempt to [Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resuming).\n\n> info\n> In the event of a service outage where you stay connected to the gateway, you should continue to heartbeat and receive ACKs. The gateway will eventually respond and issue a session once it\'s able to.\n\n### Identifying\n\nNext, the client is expected to send an [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify):\n\n###### Example Gateway Identify\n\nThis is a minimal `IDENTIFY` payload. `IDENTIFY` supports additional optional fields for other session properties, such as payload compression, or an initial presence state. See the [Identify Structure](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify) for a more complete example of all options you can pass in.\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 2,\n  "d": {\n    "token": "my_token",\n    "intents": 513,\n    "properties": {\n      "$os": "linux",\n      "$browser": "my_library",\n      "$device": "my_library"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the payload is valid, the gateway will respond with a [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) event. Your client is now considered in a "connected" state. Clients are limited by [maximum concurrency](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/session-start-limit-object) when [Identifying](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify); if they exceed this limit, the gateway will respond with an [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session). It is important to note that although the ready event contains a large portion of the required initial state, some information (such as guilds and their members) is sent asynchronously (see [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) event).\n\n> warn\n> Clients are limited to 1000 `IDENTIFY` calls to the websocket in a 24-hour period. This limit is global and across all shards, but does not include `RESUME` calls. Upon hitting this limit, all active sessions for the bot will be terminated, the bot\'s token will be reset, and the owner will receive an email notification. It\'s up to the owner to update their application with the new token.\n\n## Resuming\n\nThe Internet is a scary place. Disconnections happen, especially with persistent connections. Due to Discord\'s architecture, this is a semi-regular event and should be expected and handled. Discord has a process for "resuming" (or reconnecting) a connection that allows the client to replay any lost events from the last sequence number they received in the exact same way they would receive them normally.\n\nYour client should store the `session_id` from the [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready), and the sequence number of the last event it received. When your client detects that it has been disconnected, it should completely close the connection and open a new one (following the same strategy as [Connecting](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/connecting)). Once the new connection has been opened, the client should send a [Gateway Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume):\n\n###### Example Gateway Resume\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 6,\n  "d": {\n    "token": "my_token",\n    "session_id": "session_id_i_stored",\n    "seq": 1337\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf successful, the gateway will respond by replaying all missed events in order, finishing with a [Resumed](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resumed) event to signal replay has finished, and all subsequent events are new. It\'s also possible that your client cannot reconnect in time to resume, in which case the client will receive a [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session) and is expected to wait a random amount of time—between 1 and 5 seconds—then send a fresh [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify).\n\n### Disconnections\n\nIf the gateway ever issues a disconnect to your client, it will provide a close event code that you can use to properly handle the disconnection. A full list of these close codes can be found in the [Response Codes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-gateway-close-event-codes) documentation.\n\nWhen you close the connection to the gateway with the close code 1000 or 1001, your session will be invalidated and your bot will appear offline. If you simply close the TCP connection, or use a different close code, the bot session will remain active and timeout after a few minutes. This can be useful for a reconnect, which will resume the previous session.\n\n## Gateway Intents\n\n> info\n> Intents are optionally supported on the v6 gateway but required as of v8\n\nMaintaining a stateful application can be difficult when it comes to the amount of data you\'re expected to process, especially at scale. Gateway Intents are a system to help you lower that computational burden.\n\nWhen [identifying](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identifying) to the gateway, you can specify an `intents` parameter which allows you to conditionally subscribe to pre-defined "intents", groups of events defined by Discord. If you do not specify a certain intent, you will not receive any of the gateway events that are batched into that group. The valid intents are:\n\n### List of Intents\n\n```\nGUILDS (1 << 0)\n  - GUILD_CREATE\n  - GUILD_UPDATE\n  - GUILD_DELETE\n  - GUILD_ROLE_CREATE\n  - GUILD_ROLE_UPDATE\n  - GUILD_ROLE_DELETE\n  - CHANNEL_CREATE\n  - CHANNEL_UPDATE\n  - CHANNEL_DELETE\n  - CHANNEL_PINS_UPDATE\n  - THREAD_CREATE\n  - THREAD_UPDATE\n  - THREAD_DELETE\n  - THREAD_LIST_SYNC\n  - THREAD_MEMBER_UPDATE\n  - THREAD_MEMBERS_UPDATE *\n  - STAGE_INSTANCE_CREATE\n  - STAGE_INSTANCE_UPDATE\n  - STAGE_INSTANCE_DELETE\n\nGUILD_MEMBERS (1 << 1)\n  - GUILD_MEMBER_ADD\n  - GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE\n  - GUILD_MEMBER_REMOVE\n  - THREAD_MEMBERS_UPDATE *\n\nGUILD_BANS (1 << 2)\n  - GUILD_BAN_ADD\n  - GUILD_BAN_REMOVE\n\nGUILD_EMOJIS_AND_STICKERS (1 << 3)\n  - GUILD_EMOJIS_UPDATE\n  - GUILD_STICKERS_UPDATE\n\nGUILD_INTEGRATIONS (1 << 4)\n  - GUILD_INTEGRATIONS_UPDATE\n  - INTEGRATION_CREATE\n  - INTEGRATION_UPDATE\n  - INTEGRATION_DELETE\n\nGUILD_WEBHOOKS (1 << 5)\n  - WEBHOOKS_UPDATE\n\nGUILD_INVITES (1 << 6)\n  - INVITE_CREATE\n  - INVITE_DELETE\n\nGUILD_VOICE_STATES (1 << 7)\n  - VOICE_STATE_UPDATE\n\nGUILD_PRESENCES (1 << 8)\n  - PRESENCE_UPDATE\n\nGUILD_MESSAGES (1 << 9)\n  - MESSAGE_CREATE\n  - MESSAGE_UPDATE\n  - MESSAGE_DELETE\n  - MESSAGE_DELETE_BULK\n\nGUILD_MESSAGE_REACTIONS (1 << 10)\n  - MESSAGE_REACTION_ADD\n  - MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE\n  - MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_ALL\n  - MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_EMOJI\n\nGUILD_MESSAGE_TYPING (1 << 11)\n  - TYPING_START\n\nDIRECT_MESSAGES (1 << 12)\n  - MESSAGE_CREATE\n  - MESSAGE_UPDATE\n  - MESSAGE_DELETE\n  - CHANNEL_PINS_UPDATE\n\nDIRECT_MESSAGE_REACTIONS (1 << 13)\n  - MESSAGE_REACTION_ADD\n  - MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE\n  - MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_ALL\n  - MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_EMOJI\n\nDIRECT_MESSAGE_TYPING (1 << 14)\n  - TYPING_START\n```\n\n\\* [Thread Members Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-members-update) contains different data depending on which intents are used.\n\n### Caveats\n\nAny [events not defined in an intent](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/commands-and-events-gateway-events) are considered "passthrough" and will always be sent to you.\n\n[Guild Member Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-member-update) is sent for current-user updates regardless of whether the `GUILD_MEMBERS` intent is set.\n\n[Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) and [Request Guild Members](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/request-guild-members) are uniquely affected by intents. See these sections for more information.\n\n[Thread Members Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-members-update) by default only includes if the current user was added to or removed from a thread.  To receive these updates for other users, request the `GUILD_MEMBERS` [Gateway Intent](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents).\n\nIf you specify an `intents` value in your `IDENTIFY` payload that is *invalid*, the socket will close with a [`4013` close code](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-gateway-close-event-codes). An invalid intent is one that is not meaningful and not documented above.\n\nIf you specify an `intents` value in your `IDENTIFY` payload that is *disallowed*, the socket will close with a [`4014` close code](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-gateway-close-event-codes). A disallowed intent is a privileged intent that has not been approved for your bot.\n\nBots in under 100 guilds can enable these intents in the bot tab of the developer dashboard. Verified bots can get access to privileged intents when getting verified, or by writing into support after getting verified.\n\n### Privileged Intents\n\n> warn\n> Message content will become a privileged intent in 2022. [Learn more here](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055).\n\nSome intents are defined as "Privileged" due to the sensitive nature of the data. Those intents are:\n\n- `GUILD_PRESENCES`\n- `GUILD_MEMBERS`\n\nTo specify these intents in your `IDENTIFY` payload, you must visit your application page in the Developer Portal and enable the toggle for each Privileged Intent that you wish to use. If your bot qualifies for [verification](https://dis.gd/bot-verification), you must first [verify your bot](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040720412-Bot-Verification-and-Data-Whitelisting) and request access to these intents during the verification process. If your bot is already verified and you need to request additional privileged intents, [contact support](https://dis.gd/support).\n\nEvents under the `GUILD_PRESENCES` and `GUILD_MEMBERS` intents are turned **off by default on all gateway versions**. If you are using **Gateway v6**, you will receive those events if you are authorized to receive them and have enabled the intents in the Developer Portal. You do not need to use Intents on Gateway v6 to receive these events; you just need to enable the flags.\n\nIf you are using **Gateway v8** or above, Intents are mandatory and must be specified when identifying.\n\nIn addition to the gateway restrictions described here, Discord\'s REST API is also affected by Privileged Intents. Specifically, to use the [List Guild Members](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/list-guild-members) endpoint, you must have the `GUILD_MEMBERS` intent enabled for your application. This behavior is independent of whether the intent is set during `IDENTIFY`.\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\n> info\n> This section is about Gateway rate limits, not [HTTP API rate limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/)\n\nClients are allowed to send 120 [gateway commands](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/commands-and-events) every 60 seconds, meaning you can send an average of 2 commands per second. Clients who surpass this limit are immediately disconnected from the Gateway, and similarly to the HTTP API, repeat offenders will have their API access revoked. Clients also have a limit of [concurrent](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/session-start-limit-object) [Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify) requests allowed per 5 seconds. If you hit this limit, the Gateway will respond with an [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session).\n\n## Tracking State\n\nMost of a client\'s state is provided during the initial [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) event and the [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events that immediately follow. As objects are further created/updated/deleted, other events are sent to notify the client of these changes and to provide the new or updated data. To avoid excessive API calls, Discord expects clients to locally cache as many _relevant_ object states as possible, and to update them as gateway events are received.\n\nAn example of state tracking can be found with member status caching. When initially connecting to the gateway, the client receives information regarding the online status of guild members (online, idle, dnd, offline). To keep this state updated, a client must track and parse [Presence Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update) events as they are received, and apply the provided data to the cached member objects.\n\nFor larger bots, client state can grow to be quite large. We recommend only storing objects in memory that are needed for a bot\'s operation. Many bots, for example, just respond to user input through chat commands. These bots may only need to keep guild information (like guild/channel roles and permissions) in memory, since [MESSAGE_CREATE](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) and [MESSAGE_UPDATE](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-update) events have the full member object available.\n\n## Guild Availability\n\nWhen connecting to the gateway as a bot user, guilds that the bot is a part of will start out as unavailable. Don\'t fret! The gateway will automatically attempt to reconnect on your behalf. As guilds become available to you, you will receive [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events.\n\n## Sharding\n\nAs bots grow and are added to an increasing number of guilds, some developers may find it necessary to break or split portions of their bots operations into separate logical processes. As such, Discord gateways implement a method of user-controlled guild sharding which allows for splitting events across a number of gateway connections. Guild sharding is entirely user controlled, and requires no state-sharing between separate connections to operate.\n\nTo enable sharding on a connection, the user should send the `shard` array in the [Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify) payload. The first item in this array should be the zero-based integer value of the current shard, while the second represents the total number of shards. DMs will only be sent to shard 0. To calculate what events will be sent to what shard, the following formula can be used:\n\n###### Sharding Formula\n\n```python\nshard_id = (guild_id >> 22) % num_shards\n```\n\nAs an example, if you wanted to split the connection between three shards, you\'d use the following values for `shard` for each connection: `[0, 3]`, `[1, 3]`, and `[2, 3]`. Note that only the first shard (`[0, 3]`) would receive DMs.\n\nNote that `num_shards` does not relate to, or limit, the total number of potential sessions—it is only used for *routing* traffic. As such, sessions do not have to be identified in an evenly distributed manner when sharding. You can establish multiple sessions with the same `[shard_id, num_shards]`, or sessions with different `num_shards` values. This allows you to create sessions that will handle more or less traffic than others for more fine-tuned load balancing, or orchestrate "zero-downtime" scaling/updating by handing off traffic to a new deployment of sessions with a higher or lower `num_shards` count that are prepared in parallel.\n\n###### Max Concurrency\n\nIf you have multiple shards, you may start them concurrently based on the [`max_concurrency`](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/session-start-limit-object) value returned to you on session start. Which shards you can start concurrently are assigned based on a key for each shard. The rate limit key for a given shard can be computed with\n\n```\nrate_limit_key = shard_id % max_concurrency\n```\n\nThis puts your shards into "buckets" of `max_concurrency` size. When you start your bot, you may start up to `max_concurrency` shards at a time, and you must start them by "bucket" **in order**. To explain another way, let\'s say you have 16 shards, and your `max_concurrency` is 16:\n\n```\nshard_id: 0, rate limit key (0 % 16): 0\nshard_id: 1, rate limit key (1 % 16): 1\nshard_id: 2, rate limit key (2 % 16): 2\nshard_id: 3, rate limit key (3 % 16): 3\nshard_id: 4, rate limit key (4 % 16): 4\nshard_id: 5, rate limit key (5 % 16): 5\nshard_id: 6, rate limit key (6 % 16): 6\nshard_id: 7, rate limit key (7 % 16): 7\nshard_id: 8, rate limit key (8 % 16): 8\nshard_id: 9, rate limit key (9 % 16): 9\nshard_id: 10, rate limit key (10 % 16): 10\nshard_id: 11, rate limit key (11 % 16): 11\nshard_id: 12, rate limit key (12 % 16): 12\nshard_id: 13, rate limit key (13 % 16): 13\nshard_id: 14, rate limit key (14 % 16): 14\nshard_id: 15, rate limit key (15 % 16): 15\n```\n\nYou may start all 16 of your shards at once, because each has a `rate_limit_key` which fills the bucket of 16 shards. However, let\'s say you had 32 shards:\n\n```\nshard_id: 0, rate limit key (0 % 16): 0\nshard_id: 1, rate limit key (1 % 16): 1\nshard_id: 2, rate limit key (2 % 16): 2\nshard_id: 3, rate limit key (3 % 16): 3\nshard_id: 4, rate limit key (4 % 16): 4\nshard_id: 5, rate limit key (5 % 16): 5\nshard_id: 6, rate limit key (6 % 16): 6\nshard_id: 7, rate limit key (7 % 16): 7\nshard_id: 8, rate limit key (8 % 16): 8\nshard_id: 9, rate limit key (9 % 16): 9\nshard_id: 10, rate limit key (10 % 16): 10\nshard_id: 11, rate limit key (11 % 16): 11\nshard_id: 12, rate limit key (12 % 16): 12\nshard_id: 13, rate limit key (13 % 16): 13\nshard_id: 14, rate limit key (14 % 16): 14\nshard_id: 15, rate limit key (15 % 16): 15\nshard_id: 16, rate limit key (16 % 16): 0\nshard_id: 17, rate limit key (17 % 16): 1\nshard_id: 18, rate limit key (18 % 16): 2\nshard_id: 19, rate limit key (19 % 16): 3\nshard_id: 20, rate limit key (20 % 16): 4\nshard_id: 21, rate limit key (21 % 16): 5\nshard_id: 22, rate limit key (22 % 16): 6\nshard_id: 23, rate limit key (23 % 16): 7\nshard_id: 24, rate limit key (24 % 16): 8\nshard_id: 25, rate limit key (25 % 16): 9\nshard_id: 26, rate limit key (26 % 16): 10\nshard_id: 27, rate limit key (27 % 16): 11\nshard_id: 28, rate limit key (28 % 16): 12\nshard_id: 29, rate limit key (29 % 16): 13\nshard_id: 30, rate limit key (30 % 16): 14\nshard_id: 31, rate limit key (31 % 16): 15\n```\n\nIn this case, you must start the shard buckets **in "order"**. That means that you can start shard 0 -> shard 15 concurrently, and then you can start shard 16 -> shard 31.\n\n## Sharding for Very Large Bots\n\nIf you own a bot that is near or in over 150,000 guilds, there are some additional considerations you must take around sharding. Please file a support-ticket to get moved to the sharding for big bots, when you reach near this amount of servers. You can contact the discord support using [https://dis.gd/contact](https://dis.gd/contact).\n\nThe number of shards you run must be a multiple of a fixed number we will determine when reaching out to you. If you attempt to start your bot with an invalid number of shards, your websocket connection will close with a 4010 Invalid Shard opcode. The gateway bot bootstrap endpoint will return the correct amount of shards, so if you\'re already using this endpoint to determine your number of shards, you shouldn\'t require any further changes.\n\nThe session start limit for these bots will also be increased from 1000 to `max(2000, (guild_count / 1000) * 3)` per day. You also receive an increased `max_concurrency`, the number of [shards you can concurrently start](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/session-start-limit-object).\n\nFinally, the [Get Current User Guilds](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user-guilds) endpoint will no longer return results for your bot. We will be creating a new endpoint that is more shard-aware to iterate through your bot\'s guilds if needed.\n\n## Commands and Events\n\nCommands are requests made to the gateway socket by a

Within the following documentation, they have been left in standard English form to aid in readability.\n\n#### Identify\n\nUsed to trigger the initial handshake with the gateway.\n\n###### Identify Structure\n\n| Field                | Type                                                       | Description                                                                                                                    | Default |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| token                | string                                                     | authentication token                                                                                                           | -       |\n| properties           | object                                                     | [connection properties](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify-identify-connection-properties)                                          | -       |\n| compress?            | boolean                                                    | whether this connection supports compression of packets                                                                        | false   |\n| large_threshold?     | integer                                                    | value between 50 and 250, total number of members where the gateway will stop sending offline members in the guild member list | 50      |\n| shard?               | array of two integers (shard_id, num_shards)               | used for [Guild Sharding](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sharding)                                                                       | -       |\n| presence?            | [update presence](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/update-presence) object | presence structure for initial presence information                                                                            | -       |\n| intents              | integer                                                    | the [Gateway Intents](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents) you wish to receive                                                | -       |\n\n###### Identify Connection Properties\n\n| Field     | Type   | Description           |\n|-----------|--------|-----------------------|\n| \\$os      | string | your operating system |\n| \\$browser | string | your library name     |\n| \\$device  | string | your library name     |\n\n###### Example Identify\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 2,\n  "d": {\n    "token": "my_token",\n    "properties": {\n      "$os": "linux",\n      "$browser": "disco",\n      "$device": "disco"\n    },\n    "compress": true,\n    "large_threshold": 250,\n    "shard": [0, 1],\n    "presence": {\n      "activities": [{\n        "name": "Cards Against Humanity",\n        "type": 0\n      }],\n      "status": "dnd",\n      "since": 91879201,\n      "afk": false\n    },\n    // This intent represents 1 << 0 for GUILDS, 1 << 1 for GUILD_MEMBERS, and 1 << 2 for GUILD_BANS\n    // This connection will only receive the events defined in those three intents\n    "intents": 7\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Resume\n\nUsed to replay missed events when a disconnected client resumes.\n\n###### Resume Structure\n\n| Field      | Type    | Description                   |\n|------------|---------|-------------------------------|\n| token      | string  | session token                 |\n| session_id | string  | session id                    |\n| seq        | integer | last sequence number received |\n\n###### Example Resume\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 6,\n  "d": {\n    "token": "randomstring",\n    "session_id": "evenmorerandomstring",\n    "seq": 1337\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Heartbeat\n\nUsed to maintain an active gateway connection. Must be sent every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds after the [Opcode 10 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/hello) payload is received. The inner `d` key is the last sequence number—`s`—received by the client. If you have not yet received one, send `null`.\n\n###### Example Heartbeat\n\n```\n{\n\t"op": 1,\n\t"d": 251\n}\n```\n\n#### Request Guild Members\n\nUsed to request all members for a guild or a list of guilds. When initially connecting, if you don\'t have the `GUILD_PRESENCES` [Gateway Intent](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents), or if the guild is over 75k members, it will only send members who are in voice, plus the member for you (the connecting user). Otherwise, if a guild has over `large_threshold` members (value in the [Gateway Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify)), it will only send members who are online, have a role, have a nickname, or are in a voice channel, and if it has under `large_threshold` members, it will send all members. If a client wishes to receive additional members, they need to explicitly request them via this operation. The server will send [Guild Members Chunk](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-members-chunk) events in response with up to 1000 members per chunk until all members that match the request have been sent.\n\nDue to our privacy and infrastructural concerns with this feature, there are some limitations that apply:\n\n- `GUILD_PRESENCES` intent is required to set `presences = true`. Otherwise, it will always be false\n- `GUILD_MEMBERS` intent is required to request the entire member list—`(query=‘’, limit=0<=n)`\n- You will be limited to requesting 1 `guild_id` per request\n- Requesting a prefix (`query` parameter) will return a maximum of 100 members\n- Requesting `user_ids` will continue to be limited to returning 100 members\n\n###### Guild Request Members Structure\n\n| Field      | Type                             | Description                                                                                                                           | Required                   |\n|------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| guild_id   | snowflake                        | id of the guild to get members for                                                                                                    | true                       |\n| query?     | string                           | string that username starts with, or an empty string to return all members                                                            | one of query or user_ids   |\n| limit      | integer                          | maximum number of members to send matching the `query`; a limit of `0` can be used with an empty string `query` to return all members | true when specifying query |\n| presences? | boolean                          | used to specify if we want the presences of the matched members                                                                       | false                      |\n| user_ids?  | snowflake or array of snowflakes | used to specify which users you wish to fetch                                                                                         | one of query or user_ids   |\n| nonce?     | string                           | nonce to identify the [Guild Members Chunk](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-members-chunk) response                                        | false                      |\n\n> info\n> Nonce can only be up to 32 bytes.

The ready event can be the largest and most complex event the gateway will send, as it contains all the state required for a client to begin interacting with the rest of the platform.\n\n`guilds` are the guilds of which your bot is a member. They start out as unavailable when you connect to the gateway. As they become available, your bot will be notified via [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events.\n\n###### Ready Event Fields\n\n| Field            | Type                                                                                 | Description                                                                                                   |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| v                | integer                                                                              | [gateway version](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways-gateway-versions)                                             |\n| user             | [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) object                                      | information about the user including email                                                                    |\n| guilds           | array of [Unavailable Guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/unavailable-guild-object) objects | the guilds the user is in                                                                                     |\n| session_id       | string                                                                               | used for resuming connections                                                                                 |\n| shard?           | array of two integers (shard_id, num_shards)                                         | the [shard information](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sharding) associated with this session, if sent when identifying |\n| application      | partial [application object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/application-object)         | contains `id` and `flags`                                                                                     |\n\n#### Resumed\n\nThe resumed event is dispatched when a client has sent a [resume payload](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume) to the gateway (for resuming existing sessions).\n\n#### Reconnect\n\nThe reconnect event is dispatched when a client should reconnect to the gateway (and resume their existing session, if they have one). This event usually occurs during deploys to migrate sessions gracefully off old hosts.\n\n###### Example Gateway Reconnect\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 7,\n  "d": null\n}\n```\n\n#### Invalid Session\n\nSent to indicate one of at least three different situations:\n\n- the gateway could not initialize a session after receiving an [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify)\n- the gateway could not resume a previous session after receiving an [Opcode 6 Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume)\n- the gateway has invalidated an active session and is requesting client action\n\nThe inner `d` key is a boolean that indicates whether the session may be resumable. See [Connecting](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/connecting) and [Resuming](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resuming) for more information.\n\n###### Example Gateway Invalid Session\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 9,\n  "d": false\n}\n```\n\n### Channels\n\n#### Channel Create\n\nSent when a new guild channel is created, relevant to the current user. The inner payload is a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object.\n\n#### Channel Update\n\nSent when a channel is updated. The inner payload is a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object. This is not sent when the field `last_message_id` is altered. To keep track of the last_message_id changes, you must listen for [Message Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) events.\n\n#### Channel Delete\n\nSent when a channel relevant to the current user is deleted. The inner payload is a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object.\n\n#### Thread Create\n\nSent when a thread is created, relevant to the current user, or when the current user is added to a thread. The inner payload is a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object.  When being added to an existing private thread, includes a [thread member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/thread-member-object) object.\n\n#### Thread Update\n\nSent when a thread is updated. The inner payload is a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object. This is not sent when the field `last_message_id` is altered. To keep track of the last_message_id changes, you must listen for [Message Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) events.\n\n#### Thread Delete\n\nSent when a thread relevant to the current user is deleted.

e.exports='# OAuth2\n\nOAuth2 enables application developers to build applications that utilize authentication and data from the Discord API. Within Discord, there are multiple types of OAuth2 authentication. We support the authorization code grant, the implicit grant, client credentials, and some modified special-for-Discord flows for Bots and Webhooks.\n\n## Shared Resources\n\nThe first step in implementing OAuth2 is [registering a developer application](#APPLICATIONS) and retrieving your client ID and client secret. Most people who will be implementing OAuth2 will want to find and utilize a library in the language of their choice. For those implementing OAuth2 from scratch, please see [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for details. After you create your application with Discord, make sure that you have your `client_id` and `client_secret` handy. The next step is to figure out which OAuth2 flow is right for your purposes.\n\n###### OAuth2 URLs\n\n| URL                                         | Description                                                 |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize    | Base authorization URL                                      |\n| https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token        | Token URL                                                   |\n| https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token/revoke | [Token Revocation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009) URL |\n\n> warn\n> In accordance with the relevant RFCs, the token and token revocation URLs will **only** accept a content type of `x-www-form-urlencoded`. JSON content is not permitted and will return an error.\n\n###### OAuth2 Scopes\n\nThese are a list of all the OAuth2 scopes that Discord supports. Some scopes require approval from Discord to use. Requesting them from a user without approval from Discord may cause errors or undocumented behavior in the OAuth2 flow.\n\n| Name                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| activities.read              | allows your app to fetch data from a user\'s "Now Playing/Recently Played" list -

Also, in order to add a user to a guild, your bot has to already belong to that guild.\n\n## State and Security\n\nBefore we dive into the semantics of the different OAuth2 grants, we should stop and discuss security, specifically the use of the `state` parameter. [Cross-site request forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery), or CSRF, and [Clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking) are security vulnerabilities that must be addressed by individuals implementing OAuth. This is typically accomplished using the `state` parameter. `state` is sent in the authorization request and returned back in the response and should be a value that binds the user\'s request to their authenticated state. For example, `state` could be a hash of the user\'s session cookie, or some other nonce that can be linked to the user\'s session.\n\nWhen a user begins an authorization flow on the client, a `state` is generated that is unique to that user\'s request. This value is stored somewhere only accessible to the client and the user, i.e. protected by the [same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy). When the user is redirected, the `state` parameter is returned. The client validates the request by checking that the `state` returned matches the stored value. If they match, it is a valid authorization request. If they do not match, it\'s possible that someone intercepted the request or otherwise falsely authorized themselves to another user\'s resources, and the request should be denied.\n\nWhile Discord does not require the use of the `state` parameter, we support it and highly recommend that you implement it for the security of your own applications and data.\n\n## Authorization Code Grant\n\nThe authorization code grant is what most developers will recognize as "standard OAuth2" and involves retrieving an access code and exchanging it for a user\'s access token. It allows the authorization server to act as an intermediary between the client and the resource owner, so the resource owner\'s credentials are never shared directly with the client.\n\n###### Authorization URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=157730590492196864&scope=identify%20guilds.join&state=15773059ghq9183habn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnicememe.website&prompt=consent\n```\n\n`client_id` is your application\'s `client_id`. `scope` is a list of [OAuth2 scopes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) separated by url encoded spaces (`%20`). `redirect_uri` is whatever URL you registered when creating your application, url-encoded. `state` is the unique string mentioned in [State and Security](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/state-and-security).\n\nWhen someone navigates to this URL, they will be prompted to authorize your application for the requested scopes. On acceptance, they will be redirected to your `redirect_uri`, which will contain an additional querystring parameter, `code`. `state` will also be returned if previously sent, and should be validated at this point.\n\n`prompt` controls how the authorization flow handles existing authorizations. If a user has previously authorized your application with the requested scopes and prompt is set to `consent`, it will request them to reapprove their authorization. If set to `none`, it will skip the authorization screen and redirect them back to your redirect URI without requesting their authorization. For passthrough scopes, like `bot` and `webhook.incoming`, authorization is always required.\n\n###### Redirect URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://nicememe.website/?code=NhhvTDYsFcdgNLnnLijcl7Ku7bEEeee&state=15773059ghq9183habn\n```\n\n`code` is now exchanged for the user\'s access token by making a `POST` request to the [token URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-urls) with the following parameters:\n\n- `client_id` - your application\'s client id\n- `client_secret` - your application\'s client secret\n- `grant_type` - must be set to `authorization_code`\n- `code` - the code from the querystring\n- `redirect_uri` - your `redirect_uri`\n\n###### Access Token Exchange Example\n\n```python\nAPI_ENDPOINT = \'https://discord.com/api/v8\'\nCLIENT_ID = \'332269999912132097\'\nCLIENT_SECRET = \'937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire\'\nREDIRECT_URI = \'https://nicememe.website\'\n\ndef exchange_code(code):\n  data = {\n    \'client_id\': CLIENT_ID,\n    \'client_secret\': CLIENT_SECRET,\n    \'grant_type\': \'authorization_code\',\n    \'code\': code,\n    \'redirect_uri\': REDIRECT_URI\n  }\n  headers = {\n    \'Content-Type\': \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n  }\n  r = requests.post(\'%s/oauth2/token\' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers)\n  r.raise_for_status()\n  return r.json()\n```\n\nYou can also pass your `client_id` and `client_secret` as basic authentication with `client_id` as the username and `client_secret` as the password. In response, you will receive:\n\n###### Access Token Response\n\n```json\n{\n  "access_token": "6qrZcUqja7812RVdnEKjpzOL4CvHBFG",\n  "token_type": "Bearer",\n  "expires_in": 604800,\n  "refresh_token": "D43f5y0ahjqew82jZ4NViEr2YafMKhue",\n  "scope": "identify"\n}\n```\n\nHaving the user\'s access token allows your application to make certain requests to the API on their behalf, restricted to whatever scopes were requested. `expires_in` is how long, in seconds, until the returned access token expires, allowing you to anticipate the expiration and refresh the token. To refresh, make another `POST` request to the [token URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-urls) with the following parameters:\n\n- `client_id` - your application\'s client id\n- `client_secret` - your application\'s client secret\n- `grant_type` - must be set to `refresh_token`\n- `refresh_token` - the user\'s refresh token\n\n###### Refresh Token Exchange Example\n\n```python\nAPI_ENDPOINT = \'https://discord.com/api/v8\'\nCLIENT_ID = \'332269999912132097\'\nCLIENT_SECRET = \'937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire\'\nREDIRECT_URI = \'https://nicememe.website\'\n\ndef refresh_token(refresh_token):\n  data = {\n    \'client_id\': CLIENT_ID,\n    \'client_secret\': CLIENT_SECRET,\n    \'grant_type\': \'refresh_token\',\n    \'refresh_token\': refresh_token\n  }\n  headers = {\n    \'Content-Type\': \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n  }\n  r = requests.post(\'%s/oauth2/token\' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers)\n  r.raise_for_status()\n  return r.json()\n```\n\nBoom; fresh [access token response](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant-access-token-response)!\n\n## Implicit Grant\n\nThe implicit OAuth2 grant is a simplified flow optimized for in-browser clients. Instead of issuing the client an authorization code to be exchanged for an access token, the client is directly issued an access token. The URL is formatted as follows:\n\n###### Authorization URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=290926444748734499&state=15773059ghq9183habn&scope=identify\n```\n\nOn redirect, your redirect URI will contain additional **URI fragments**: `access_token`, `token_type`, `expires_in`, `scope`, and [`state`](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/state-and-security)(if specified). **These are not querystring parameters.** Be mindful of the "#" character:\n\n###### Redirect URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://findingfakeurlsisprettyhard.tv/#access_token=RTfP0OK99U3kbRtHOoKLmJbOn45PjL&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=604800&scope=identify&state=15773059ghq9183habn\n```\n\nThere are tradeoffs in using the implicit grant flow. It is both quicker and easier to implement, but rather than exchanging a code and getting a token returned in a secure HTTP body, the access token is returned in the URI fragment, which makes it possibly exposed to unauthorized parties. **You also are not returned a refresh token, so the user must explicitly re-authorize once their token expires.**\n\n## Client Credentials Grant\n\nThe client credential flow is a quick and easy way for bot developers to get their own bearer tokens for testing purposes. By making a `POST` request to the [token URL](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-urls) with a grant type of `client_credentials`, using Basic authentication with your client id as the username and your client secret as the password, you will be returned an access token for the bot owner. Therefore, always be super-extra-very-we-are-not-kidding-like-really-be-secure-make-sure-your-info-is-not-in-your-source-code careful with your `client_id` and `client_secret`. We don\'t take kindly to imposters around these parts.\n\nYou can specify scopes with the `scope` parameter, which is a list of [OAuth2 scopes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) separated by spaces:\n\n> info\n> Team applications are limited to the `identify` and `applications.commands.update` scope, because teams are not bound to a specific user.\n\n###### Client Credentials Token Request Example\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\nAPI_ENDPOINT = \'https://discord.com/api/v8\'\nCLIENT_ID = \'332269999912132097\'\nCLIENT_SECRET = \'937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire\'\n\ndef get_token():\n  data = {\n    \'grant_type\': \'client_credentials\',\n    \'scope\': \'identify connections\'\n  }\n  headers = {\n    \'Content-Type\': \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n  }\n  r = requests.post(\'%s/oauth2/token\' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers, auth=(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))\n  r.raise_for_status()\n  return r.json()\n```\n\nIn return, you will receive an access token (without a refresh token):\n\n###### Client Credentials Access Token Response\n\n```json\n{\n  "access_token": "6qrZcUqja7812RVdnEKjpzOL4CvHBFG",\n  "token_type": "Bearer",\n  "expires_in": 604800,\n  "scope": "identify connections"\n}\n```\n\n## Bots\n\nSo, what are bot accounts?\n\n### Bot vs User Accounts\n\nDiscord\'s API provides a separate type of user account dedicated to automation, called a bot account. Bot accounts can be created through the [applications page](#APPLICATIONS), and are authenticated using a token (rather than a username and password). Unlike the normal OAuth2 flow, bot accounts have full access to all API routes without using bearer tokens, and can connect to the [Real Time Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways). Automating normal user accounts (generally called "self-bots") outside of the OAuth2/bot API is forbidden, and can result in account termination if found.\n\nBot accounts have a few differences in comparison to normal user accounts, namely:\n\n1. Bots are added to guilds through the OAuth2 API, and cannot accept normal invites.\n2. Bots cannot have friends, nor be added to or join Group DMs.\n3. Verified bots do not have a maximum number of Guilds.\n4. Bots have an entirely separate set of [Rate Limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/rate-limits).\n\n### Bot Authorization Flow\n\nBot authorization is a special server-less and callback-less OAuth2 flow that makes it easy for users to add bots to guilds. The URL you create looks similar to what we use for full stack implementation:\n\n###### Bot Auth Parameters\n\n| name                 | description                                                           |\n| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| client_id            | your app\'s client id                                                  |\n| scope                | needs to include `bot` for the bot flow                               |\n| permissions          | the [permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/) you\'re requesting        |\n| guild_id             | pre-fills the dropdown picker with a guild for the user               |\n| disable_guild_select | `true` or `false`—disallows the user from changing the guild dropdown |\n\n###### URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=157730590492196864&scope=bot&permissions=1\n```\n\nIn the case of bots, the `scope` parameter should be set to `bot`. There\'s also a new parameter, `permissions`, which is an integer corresponding to the [permission calculations](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions-bitwise-permission-flags) for the bot. You\'ll also notice the absence of `response_type` and `redirect_uri`. Bot authorization does not require these parameters because there is no need to retrieve the user\'s access token.\n\nWhen the user navigates to this page, they\'ll be prompted to add the bot to a guild in which they have proper permissions. On acceptance, the bot will be added. Super easy!\n\nIf you happen to already know the ID of the guild the user will add your bot to, you can provide this ID in the URL as a `guild_id=GUILD_ID` parameter.\nWhen the authorization page loads, that guild will be preselected in the dialog if that user has permission to add the bot to that guild. You can use this in conjunction with the parameter `disable_guild_select=true` to disallow the user from picking a different guild.\n\nIf your bot is super specific to your private clubhouse, or you just don\'t like sharing, you can leave the `Public Bot` option unchecked in your application\'s settings. If unchecked, only you can add the bot to guilds. If marked as public, anyone with your bot\'s URL can add it to guilds in which they have proper permissions.\n\n### Advanced Bot Authorization\n\nDevs can extend the bot authorization functionality. You can request additional scopes outside of `bot`, which will prompt a continuation into a complete [authorization code grant flow](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant) and add the ability to request the user\'s access token. If you request any scopes outside of `bot`, `response_type` is again mandatory; we will also automatically redirect the user to the first URI in your application\'s registered list unless `redirect_uri` is specified.\n\nWhen receiving the access code on redirect, there will be additional querystring parameters of `guild_id` and `permissions`. The `guild_id` parameter should only be used as a hint as to the relationship between your bot and a guild. To be sure of the relationship between your bot and the guild, consider requiring the Oauth2 code grant in your bot\'s settings. Enabling it requires anyone adding your bot to a server to go through a full OAuth2 [authorization code grant flow](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant). When you retrieve the user\'s access token, you\'ll also receive information about the guild to which your bot was added:\n\n###### Extended Bot Authorization Access Token Example\n\n```json\n{\n  "token_type": "Bearer",\n  "guild": {\n    "mfa_level": 0,\n    "emojis": [],\n    "application_id": null,\n    "name": "SomeTest",\n    "roles": [\n      {\n        "hoist": false,\n        "name": "@everyone",\n        "mentionable": false,\n        "color": 0,\n        "position": 0,\n        "id": "290926798626357250",\n        "managed": false,\n        "permissions": 49794241,\n        "permissions_new": "49794241"\n      }\n    ],\n    "afk_timeout": 300,\n    "system_channel_id": null,\n    "widget_channel_id": null,\n    "region": "us-east",\n    "default_message_notifications": 1,\n    "explicit_content_filter": 0,\n    "splash": null,\n    "features": [],\n    "afk_channel_id": null,\n    "widget_enabled": false,\n    "verification_level": 0,\n    "owner_id": "53908232999183680",\n    "id": "2909267986347357250",\n    "icon": null,\n    "description": null,\n    "public_updates_channel_id": null,\n    "rules_channel_id": null,\n    "max_members": 100000,\n    "vanity_url_code": null,\n    "premium_subscription_count": 0,\n    "premium_tier": 0,\n    "preferred_locale": "en-US",\n    "system_channel_flags": 0,\n    "banner": null,\n    "max_presences": null,\n    "discovery_splash": null,\n    "max_video_channel_users": 25\n  },\n  "access_token": "zMndOe7jFLXGawdlxMOdNvXjjOce5X",\n  "scope": "bot",\n  "expires_in": 604800,\n  "refresh_token": "mgp8qnvBwJcmadwgCYKyYD5CAzGAX4"\n}\n```\n\n### Two-Factor Authentication Requirement\n\nFor bots with [elevated permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions-bitwise-permission-flags) (permissions with a `*` next to them), we enforce two-factor authentication on the owner\'s account when added to guilds that have server-wide 2FA enabled.\n\n## Webhooks\n\nDiscord\'s webhook flow is a specialized version of an [authorization code](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant) implementation. In this case, the `scope` querystring parameter needs to be set to `webhook.incoming`:\n\n###### URL Example\n\n```\nhttps://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=157730590492196864&scope=webhook.incoming&state=15773059ghq9183habn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnicememe.website\n```\n\nWhen the user navigates to this URL, they will be prompted to select a channel in which to allow the webhook. When the webhook is [executed](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK/execute-webhook), it will post its message into this channel. On acceptance, the user will be redirected to your `redirect_uri`. The URL will contain the `code` querystring parameter which should be [exchanged for an access token](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant-access-token-exchange-example). In return, you will receive a slightly modified token response:\n\n###### Webhook Token Response Example\n\n```json\n{\n  "token_type": "Bearer",\n  "access_token": "GNaVzEtATqdh173tNHEXY9ZYAuhiYxvy",\n  "scope": "webhook.incoming",\n  "expires_in": 604800,\n  "refresh_token": "PvPL7ELyMDc1836457XCDh1Y8jPbRm",\n  "webhook": {\n    "application_id": "310954232226357250",\n    "name": "testwebhook",\n    "url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/347114750880120863/kKDdjXa1g9tKNs0-_yOwLyALC9gydEWP6gr9sHabuK1vuofjhQDDnlOclJeRIvYK-pj_",\n    "channel_id": "345626669224982402",\n    "token": "kKDdjXa1g9tKNs0-_yOwLyALC9gydEWP6gr9sHabuK1vuofjhQDDnlOclJeRIvYK-pj_",\n    "type": 1,\n    "avatar": null,\n    "guild_id": "290926792226357250",\n    "id": "347114750880120863"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFrom this object, you should store the `webhook.token` and `webhook.id`. See the [execute webhook](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK/execute-webhook) documentation for how to send messages with the webhook.\n\nAny user that wishes to add your webhook to their channel will need to go through the full OAuth2 flow. A new webhook is created each time, so you will need to save the token and id. If you wish to send a message to all your webhooks, you\'ll need to iterate over each stored id:token combination and make `POST` requests to each one. Be mindful of our [Rate Limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/rate-limits)!\n\n## Get Current Bot Application Information % GET /oauth2/applications/@me\n\nReturns the bot\'s [application](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/application-object) object without `flags`.\n\n## Get Current Authorization Information % GET /oauth2/@me\n\nReturns info about the current authorization. Requires authentication with a bearer token.\n\n###### Response Structure\n\n| Field       | Type                                                                         | Description                                                                       |\n| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| application | partial [application](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/application-object) object | the current application                                                           |\n| scopes      | array of strings                                                             | the scopes the user has authorized the application for                            |\n| expires     | ISO8601 timestamp                                                            | when the access token expires                                                     |\n| user?       | [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) object                              | the user who has authorized, if the user has authorized with the `identify` scope |\n\n###### Example Authorization Information\n\n```json\n{\n    "application": {\n        "id": "159799960412356608",\n        "name": "AIRHORN SOLUTIONS",\n        "icon": "f03590d3eb764081d154a66340ea7d6d",\n        "description": "",\n        "summary": "",\n        "hook": true,\n        "bot_public": true,\n        "bot_require_code_grant": false,\n        "verify_key": "c8cde6a3c8c6e49d86af3191287b3ce255872be1fff6dc285bdb420c06a2c3c8"\n    },\n    "scopes": [\n        "guilds.join",\n        "identify"\n    ],\n    "expires": "2021-01-23T02:33:17.017000+00:00",\n    "user": {\n        "id": "268473310986240001",\n        "username": "Discord",\n        "avatar": "f749bb0cbeeb26ef21eca719337d20f1",\n        "discriminator": "0001",\n        "public_flags": 131072\n    }\n}\n```\n'

e.exports='# Permissions\n\nPermissions in Discord are a way to limit and grant certain abilities to users. A set of base permissions can be configured at the guild level for different roles. When these roles are attached to users, they grant or revoke specific privileges within the guild. Along with the guild-level permissions, Discord also supports permission overwrites that can be assigned to individual guild roles or guild members on a per-channel basis.\n\nPermissions are stored within a variable-length integer serialized into a string, and are calculated using bitwise operations. For example, the permission value `123` will be serialized as `"123"`. For long-term stability, we recommend deserializing the permissions using your languages\' Big Integer libraries. The total permissions integer can be determined by ORing together each individual value, and flags can be checked using AND operations.\n\nIn API v8, all permissions—including `allow` and `deny` fields in overwrites—are serialized as strings. There are also no longer `_new` permission fields; all new permissions are rolled back into the base field.\n\nIn API v6, the `permissions`, `allow`, and `deny` fields in roles and overwrites are still serialized as a number; however, these numbers shall not grow beyond 31 bits. During the remaining lifetime of API v6, all new permission bits will only be introduced in `permissions_new`, `allow_new`, and `deny_new`. These `_new` fields are just for response serialization; requests with these fields should continue to use the original `permissions`, `allow`, and `deny` fields, which accept both string or number values.\n\n```python\n# Permissions value that can Send Messages (0x800) and Add Reactions (0x40):\npermissions = 0x40 | 0x800 # 2112\n\n# Checking for flags that are set:\n(permissions & 0x40) == 0x40   # True\n(permissions & 0x800) == 0x800 # True\n\n# Kick Members (0x2) was not set:\n(permissions & 0x2) == 0x2 # False\n```\n\nAdditional logic is required when permission overwrites are involved; this is further explained below. For more information about bitwise operations and flags, see [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field).\n\nBelow is a table of all current permissions, their integer values in hexadecimal, brief descriptions of the privileges that they grant, and the channel type they apply to, if applicable.\n\n###### Bitwise Permission Flags\n\n| Permission                    | Value

For example, "Manage Permissions" refers to MANAGE_ROLES and "Use Voice Activity" refers to USE_VAD.\n\n## Permission Hierarchy\n\nHow permissions apply may at first seem intuitive, but there are some hidden restrictions that prevent bots from performing certain inappropriate actions based on a bot\'s highest role compared to its target\'s highest role. A bot\'s or user\'s highest role is its role that has the greatest position value in the guild, with the default @everyone role starting at 0. Permissions follow a hierarchy with the following rules:\n\n- A bot can grant roles to other users that are of a lower position than its own highest role.\n- A bot can edit roles of a lower position than its highest role, but it can only grant permissions it has to those roles.\n- A bot can only sort roles lower than its highest role.\n- A bot can only kick, ban, and edit nicknames for users whose highest role is lower than the bot\'s highest role.\n\nOtherwise, permissions do not obey the role hierarchy. For example, a user has two roles: A and B. A denies the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission on a #coolstuff channel. B allows the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission on the same #coolstuff channel. The user would ultimately be able to view the #coolstuff channel, regardless of the role positions.\n\n## Permission Overwrites\n\nCertain permissions can be applied to roles or directly to members on a channel-level by using permission overwrites. Applicable permissions are indicated by a **T** for text channels, **V** for voice channels, or **S** for stage channels in the table above.\n\nWhen using overwrites, there are cases where permission collisions could occur for a user; that is to say, the user may have certain overwrites with permissions that contradict each other or their guild-level role permissions. With this in mind, permissions are applied to users in the following hierarchy:\n\n1. Base permissions given to @everyone are applied at a guild level\n2. Permissions allowed to a user by their roles are applied at a guild level\n3. Overwrites that deny permissions for @everyone are applied at a channel level\n4. Overwrites that allow permissions for @everyone are applied at a channel level\n5. Overwrites that deny permissions for specific roles are applied at a channel level\n6. Overwrites that allow permissions for specific roles are applied at a channel level\n7. Member-specific overwrites that deny permissions are applied at a channel level\n8. Member-specific overwrites that allow permissions are applied at a channel level\n\nThe following pseudocode demonstrates this process programmatically:\n\n```python\ndef compute_base_permissions(member, guild):\n    if guild.is_owner(member):\n        return ALL\n\n    role_everyone = guild.get_role(guild.id)  # get @everyone role\n    permissions = role_everyone.permissions\n\n    for role in member.roles:\n        permissions |= role.permissions\n\n    if permissions & ADMINISTRATOR == ADMINISTRATOR:\n        return ALL\n\n    return permissions\n\ndef compute_overwrites(base_permissions, member, channel):\n    # ADMINISTRATOR overrides any potential permission overwrites, so there is nothing to do here.\n    if base_permissions & ADMINISTRATOR == ADMINISTRATOR:\n        return ALL\n\n    permissions = base_permissions\n    overwrite_everyone = overwrites.get(channel.guild_id)  # Find (@everyone) role overwrite and apply it.\n    if overwrite_everyone:\n        permissions &= ~overwrite_everyone.deny\n        permissions |= overwrite_everyone.allow\n\n    # Apply role specific overwrites.\n    overwrites = channel.permission_overwrites\n    allow = NONE\n    deny = NONE\n    for role_id in member.roles:\n        overwrite_role = overwrites.get(role_id)\n        if overwrite_role:\n            allow |= overwrite_role.allow\n            deny |= overwrite_role.deny\n\n    permissions &= ~deny\n    permissions |= allow\n\n    # Apply member specific overwrite if it exist.\n    overwrite_member = overwrites.get(member.user_id)\n    if overwrite_member:\n        permissions &= ~overwrite_member.deny\n        permissions |= overwrite_member.allow\n\n    return permissions\n\ndef compute_permissions(member, channel):\n    base_permissions = compute_base_permissions(member, channel.guild)\n    return compute_overwrites(base_permissions, member, channel)\n```\n\n## Implicit Permissions\n\nPermissions in Discord are sometimes implicitly denied or allowed based on logical use. The two main cases are `VIEW_CHANNEL` and `SEND_MESSAGES` for text channels. Denying a user or a role `VIEW_CHANNEL` on a channel implicitly denies other permissions on the channel. Though permissions like `SEND_MESSAGES` are not explicitly denied for the user, they are ignored because the user cannot read messages in the channel.\n\nDenying `SEND_MESSAGES` implicitly denies `MENTION_EVERYONE`, `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES`, `ATTACH_FILES`, and `EMBED_LINKS`. Again, they are not explicitly denied when doing permissions calculations, but they are ignored because the user cannot do the base action of sending messages.\n\nThere may be other cases in which certain permissions implicitly deny or allow other permissions. In all cases, it is based on logical conclusions about how a user with certain permissions should or should not interact with Discord.\n\n## Inherited Permissions (Threads)\n\nThreads inherit permissions from the parent channel (the channel they were created in), with one exception: The `SEND_MESSAGES` permission is not inherited, users must have `SEND_MESSAGES_IN_THREADS` to send a message in a thread, which allows for users to participate in threads in places like announcement channels.\n\nUsers must have the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission to view _any_ threads in the channel, even if they are directly mentioned or added to the thread.\n\n## Permission Syncing\n\nPermissions with regards to categories and channels within categories are a bit tricky. Rather than inheritance, permissions are calculated by means of what we call Permission Syncing. If a child channel has the same permissions and overwrites (or lack thereof) as its parent category, the channel is considered "synced" to the category. Any further changes to a **parent category** will be reflected in its synced child channels. Any further changes to a **child channel** will cause it to become de-synced from its parent category, and its permissions will no longer change with changes to its parent category.\n\n### Role Object\n\nRoles represent a set of permissions attached to a group of users. Roles have unique names, colors, and can be "pinned" to the side bar, causing their members to be listed separately. Roles are unique per guild, and can have separate permission profiles for the global context (guild) and channel context. The `@everyone` role has the same ID as the guild it belongs to.\n\n###### Role Structure\n\n| Field          | Type                                                                         | Description                                       |\n| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| id             | snowflake                                                                    | role id                                           |\n| name           | string                                                                       | role name                                         |\n| color          | integer                                                                      | integer representation of hexadecimal color code  |\n| hoist          | boolean                                                                      | if this role is pinned in the user listing        |\n| icon?          | ?string                                                                      | role [icon hash](#DOCS_REFERENCE/image-formatting)|\n| unicode_emoji? | ?string                                                                      | role unicode emoji                                |\n| position       | integer                                                                      | position of this role                             |\n| permissions    | string                                                                       | permission bit set                                |\n| managed        | boolean                                                                      | whether this role is managed by an integration    |\n| mentionable    | boolean                                                                      | whether this role is mentionable                  |\n| tags?          | [role tags](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/role-object-role-tags-structure) object | the tags this role has                            |\n\nRoles without colors (`color == 0`) do not count towards the final computed color in the user list.\n\n###### Role Tags Structure\n\n| Field               | Type      | Description                                         |\n| ------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\n| bot_id?             | snowflake | the id of the bot this role belongs to              |\n| integration_id?     | snowflake | the id of the integration this role belongs to      |\n| premium_subscriber? | null      | whether this is the guild\'s premium subscriber role |\n\n###### Example Role\n\n```json\n{\n  "id": "41771983423143936",\n  "name": "WE DEM BOYZZ!!!!!!",\n  "color": 3447003,\n  "hoist": true,\n  "icon": "cf3ced8600b777c9486c6d8d84fb4327",\n  "unicode_emoji": null,\n  "position": 1,\n  "permissions": "66321471",\n  "managed": false,\n  "mentionable": false\n}\n```\n'

e.exports='# RPC\n\n> danger\n> For now, RPC is in a private beta. We are not currently accepting any new developers into the program at this time.\n\nAll Discord clients have an RPC server running on localhost that allows control over local Discord clients.\n\n###### RPC Versions\n\n| Version | Out of Service |\n| ------- | -------------- |\n| 1       | no             |\n\n## Restrictions\n\nFor connections to the RPC server, a [list of approved testers](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/authorize) is used to restrict access while you\'re still developing. You can invite up to 50 people.\n\nFor applications/games not approved, we limit you to creating 10 guilds and 10 channels. This limit is raised to virtually unlimited after approval.\n\n## Payloads\n\n###### Payload Structure\n\n| Field | Type   | Description                                                           | Present                                                  |\n| ----- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| cmd   | enum   | [payload command](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/commands-and-events-rpc-commands)  | Always                                                   |\n| nonce | string | unique string used once for replies from the server                   | In responses to commands (not subscribed events)         |\n| evt   | enum   | [subscription event](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/commands-and-events-rpc-events) | In subscribed events, errors, and (un)subscribing events |\n| data  | object | event data                                                            | In responses from the server                             |\n| args  | object | command arguments                                                     | In commands sent to the server                           |\n\n## Connecting\n\nThe local RPC server runs on localhost (`127.0.0.1`) and is set up to process WebSocket connections and proxy API requests.\n\nFor WebSocket connections, the connection is always `ws://127.0.0.1:PORT/?v=VERSION&client_id=CLIENT_ID&encoding=ENCODING`:\n\n- `CLIENT_ID` is the client ID of the application accessing the RPC Server.\n- `VERSION` is the version of the RPC Server.\n- `PORT` is the port of the RPC Server.\n- `ENCODING` is the type of encoding for this connection to use. `json` and `etf` are supported.\n\nTo begin, you\'ll need to create an app. Head to [your apps](https://discord.com/developers/applications/me) and click the big plus button. When you create an app on our Developers site, you must specify an "RPC Origin" and "Redirect URI" from which to permit connections and authorizations. **The origin you send when connecting and the redirect uri you send when exchanging an authorization code for an access token must match one of the ones entered on the Developers site.**\n\nWhen establishing a WebSocket connection, we verify the Origin header on connection to prevent client ID spoofing. You will be instantly disconnected if the Origin does not match.\n\nIf you\'re connecting to the RPC server from within a browser, RPC origins are usually in the form `SCHEME://HOST[:PORT]`, where `SCHEME` is typically https or http, `HOST` is your domain or ip, and `PORT` is the port of the webserver from which the user will be connecting (omitted for ports 80 and 443). For example, `https://discord.com` would be used if the user were connecting from `https://discord.com/some/page/url`.\n\nIf you\'re connecting to the RPC server from within a non-browser application (like a game), you just need to make sure that the origin is sent with the upgrade request when connecting to the WebSocket. For local testing, we recommend testing with an origin like `https://localhost`. For production apps, we recommend setting the origin to your company/game\'s domain, for example `https://discord.com`.\n\n### RPC Server Ports\n\nThe port range for Discord\'s local RPC server is [6463, 6472]. Since the RPC server runs locally, there\'s a chance it might not be able to obtain its preferred port when it tries to bind to one. For this reason, the local RPC server will pick one port out of a range of these 10 ports, trying sequentially until it can bind to one. When implementing your client, you should perform the same sequential checking to find the correct port to connect to.\n\n## Authenticating\n\nIn order to call any commands over RPC, you must be authenticated or you will receive a code `4006` error response. Thankfully, we\'ve removed the oppressive nature of a couple commands that will let you `AUTHORIZE` and `AUTHENTICATE` new users. First, call [AUTHORIZE](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/authorize):\n\n###### RPC Authorize Example\n\n```json\n{\n  "nonce": "f48f6176-4afb-4c03-b1b8-d960861f5216",\n  "args": {\n    "client_id": "192741864418312192",\n    "scopes": ["rpc", "identify"]\n  },\n  "cmd": "AUTHORIZE"\n}\n```\n\nThe user will then be prompted to authorize your app to access RPC on Discord. The `AUTHORIZE` command returns a `code` that you can exchange with a POST to `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token` containing the [standard OAuth2 body parameters](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3) for the token exchange. The token endpoint on our API will return an `access_token` that can be sent with [AUTHENTICATE](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC/authenticate):\n\n###### RPC Authenticate Example\n\n```json\n{\n  "nonce": "5bb10a43-1fdc-4391-9512-0c8f4aa203d4",\n  "args": {\n    "access_token": "CZhtkLDpNYXgPH9Ml6shqh2OwykChw"\n  },\n  "cmd": "AUTHENTICATE"\n}\n```\n\nYou can now call RPC commands on behalf of the authorized user!\n\n## Commands and Events\n\nCommands are requests made to the RPC socket by a client.\n\n###### RPC Commands\n\n| Name

AUTHORIZE\n\nUsed to authenticate a new client with your app. By default this pops up a modal in-app that asks the user to authorize access to your app.\n\n**We currently do not allow access to RPC for unapproved apps without being on the game\'s list of testers**. We grant 50 testing spots, which should be ample for development. After approval, this restriction is removed and your app will be accessible to anyone.\n\nWe also have an RPC token system to bypass the user authorization modal. This is usable by approved games as well as by users on a game\'s list of testers, and also disallows use of the `messages.read` scope. If you have been granted access, you can send a POST request to `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token/rpc` with your application\'s `client_id` and `client_secret` in the body (sent as a url-encoded body, **not JSON**). You can then pass the returned `rpc_token` value to the `rpc_token` field in your RPC authorize request (documented below).\n\n###### Authorize Argument Structure\n\n| Field     | Type

e.exports='# Rate Limits\n\nDiscord\'s API rate limits requests in order to prevent abuse and overload of our services. Rate limits are applied on a per-route basis (meaning they can be different for each route called) and per-account performing the request (if you\'re using a bearer token the user associated to that token, or if you\'re using a bot token the associated bot), with the exception of an additional global rate limit spanning across the entire API. Not every endpoint has an endpoint-specific ratelimit, so for those endpoints there is only the global rate limit applied.\n\nBy "per-route," we mean that unique rate limits exist for the path you are accessing on our API, sometimes including the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and including major parameters. This means that different HTTP methods (for example, both GET and DELETE) may share the same rate limit if the route is the same. Additionally, rate limits take into account major parameters in the URL. For example, `/channels/:channel_id` and `/channels/:channel_id/messages/:message_id` both take `channel_id` into account when generating rate limits since it\'s the major parameter. Currently, the only major parameters are `channel_id`, `guild_id`, and `webhook_id + webhook_token`.\n\n"Per-route" rate limits _may_ be shared across multiple, similar-use routes (or even the same route with a different HTTP method). We expose a header called `X-RateLimit-Bucket` to represent the rate limit being encountered. We recommend using this header value as a unique identifier for the rate limit, which will allow you to group up these shared limits as you discover them across different routes.\n\nBecause we may change rate limits at any time and rate limits can be different per application, _rate limits should not be hard coded into your bot/application_. In order to properly support our dynamic rate limits, your bot/application should parse for our rate limits in response headers and locally prevent exceeding the limits as they change.\n\n> warn\n> [Routes for controlling emojis](#DOCS_RESOURCES_EMOJI/list-guild-emojis) do not follow the normal rate limit conventions. These routes are specifically limited on a per-guild basis to prevent abuse. This means that the quota returned by our APIs may be inaccurate, and you may encounter 429s.\n\n## Header Format\n\nFor most API requests made, we return optional HTTP response headers containing the rate limit encountered during your request.\n\n###### Rate Limit Header Examples\n\n```\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 5\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 0\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1470173023\nX-RateLimit-Bucket: abcd1234\n```\n\n- **X-RateLimit-Global** - Returned only on a HTTP 429 response if the rate limit headers returned are of the global rate limit (not per-route)\n- **X-RateLimit-Limit** - The number of requests that can be made\n- **X-RateLimit-Remaining** - The number of remaining requests that can be made\n- **X-RateLimit-Reset** - Epoch time (seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970) at which the rate limit resets\n- **X-RateLimit-Reset-After** - Total time (in seconds) of when the current rate limit bucket will reset. Can have decimals to match previous millisecond ratelimit precision\n- **X-RateLimit-Bucket** - A unique string denoting the rate limit being encountered (non-inclusive of major parameters in the route path)\n\n## Exceeding A Rate Limit\n\nIn the case that a rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a HTTP 429 response code with a JSON body.\n\n###### Rate Limit Response Structure\n\n| Field       | Type             | Description                                                      |\n|-------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| message     | string           | A message saying you are being rate limited.                     |\n| retry_after | float | The number of seconds to wait before submitting another request. |\n| global      | boolean          | A value indicating if you are being globally rate limited or not |\n\nNote that the normal rate-limiting headers will be sent in this response. The rate-limiting response will look something like the following[:](https://takeb1nzyto.space/)\n\n###### Example Rate Limit Response\n\n```\n< HTTP/1.1 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS\n< Content-Type: application/json\n< Retry-After: 65\n< X-RateLimit-Limit: 10\n< X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0\n< X-RateLimit-Reset: 1470173023.123\n< X-RateLimit-Reset-After: 64.57\n< X-RateLimit-Bucket: abcd1234\n{\n  "message": "You are being rate limited.",\n  "retry_after": 64.57,\n  "global": false\n}\n```\n\n###### Example Global Rate Limit Response\n\n```\n< HTTP/1.1 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS\n< Content-Type: application/json\n< Retry-After: 65\n< X-RateLimit-Global: true\n{\n  "message": "You are being rate limited.",\n  "retry_after": 64.57,\n  "global": true\n}\n```\n\n## Global Rate Limit\n\nAll bots can make up to 50 requests per second to our API. This is independent of any individual rate limit on a route. If your bot gets big enough, based on its functionality, it may be impossible to stay below 50 requests per second during normal operations.\n\nGlobal rate limit issues generally show up as repeatedly getting banned from the Discord API when your bot starts (see below). If your bot gets temporarily CloudFlare banned from the Discord API every once in a while, it is most likely **not** a global rate limit issue. You probably had a spike of errors that was not properly handled and hit our error threshold.\n\nIf you are experiencing repeated CloudFlare bans from the Discord API within normal operations of your bot, you can reach out to support to see if you qualify for increased global rate limits. You can contact Discord support using [https://dis.gd/contact](https://dis.gd/contact).\n\n## Invalid Request Limit aka CloudFlare bans\n\nIP addresses that make too many invalid HTTP requests are automatically and temporarily restricted from accessing the Discord API. Currently, this limit is **10,000 per 10 minutes**. An invalid request is one that results in **401**, **403**, or **429** statuses.\t\n\nAll applications should make reasonable attempts to avoid making invalid requests. For example:\t\n\n- **401** responses are avoided by providing a valid token in the authorization header when required and by stopping further requests after a token becomes invalid\t\n- **403** responses are avoided by inspecting role or channel permissions and by not making requests that are restricted by such permissions\t\n- **429** responses are avoided by inspecting the rate limit headers documented above and by not making requests on exhausted buckets until after they have reset\t\n\nLarge applications, especially those that can potentially make 10,000 requests per 10 minutes (a sustained 16 to 17 requests per second), should consider logging and tracking the rate of invalid requests to avoid reaching this hard limit.\n\nIn addition, you are expected to reasonably account for other invalid statuses. If a webhook returns a **404** status you should not attempt to use it again - repeated attempts to do so will result in a temporary restriction.'

e.exports="# Teams\n\nTeams are groups of developers on Discord who want to collaborate on apps. On other platforms, these may be referred to as \"organizations\", \"companies\", or \"teams\". We went with the name Teams because it best encompassed all the awesome conglomerates of devs that work together to make awesome things on Discord. Also, we never got picked for kickball in gym class, so now we get to be on a team.\n\n## What Do They Do\n\nTeams allow you and other Discord users to share access to apps. No more sharing login credentials in order to reset the token on a bot that your friend owns but you work on, or other such cases.\n\nFor game developers, this means that you can get your engineers access to your app for credentials they may need, your marketing folks access to store page management, and your finance people access to sales and performance metrics.\n\n> danger\n> For the initial release, Teams only support one kind of user: Admin. Admins have full access to all parts of an app _except_ for deleting the app and adding/removing users. That can only be done by the owner of the Team.\n\n## How Do I Make One\n\nMaking a Team is easy! Head on over to our [Team creation](https://discord.com/developers/teams) page and make your own.\n\n![Screenshot of the initial landing page for viewing Teams that you are a part of](team-page.png)\n\nNote that to use Discord Teams, you need to have 2FA enabled on your account. Security is of the utmost importance, especially when it comes to shared resources. If you're developing on your own and don't want to use Teams, you do not need 2FA. But, in order to keep other Team members safe, you'll need to add it to use Teams.\n\n![Screenshot of the 2FA requirement modal](team-2fa.png)\n\nOnce your team is made, you can start inviting other Discord users to join.\n\n> info\n> For the initial release, only the Team owner can invite or remove additional users.\n\n## Apps on Teams\n\nNow that you've got your Team set up, you can start creating apps under it. Teams can own a maximum of 25 apps. To create a new app under a Team, select the Team in the app creation modal. If you want to keep the app under your own ownership, choose `Personal`:\n\n![Screenshot of the Team Application creation modal](team-make-app.png)\n\nIf you have an existing app that you want to transfer to a Team, you can do that, too! Just go into the app that you want to transfer, hit `Transfer App to Team`, and send the app to its new home.\n\n![Screenshot of where to find the button to transfer an Application to a Team](transfer-app-to-team.png)\n\n> danger\n> Once an app has been transferred to a team, it _cannot_ be transferred back.\n\n## What Next\n\nWhat next? Go make awesome stuff! Whether you're a Game Developer, Mad Bot Scientist, or OAuth2 Enthusiast, you can now work together with other like-minded Discordians to bring your creations to life.\n\nWe've got a lot of awesome features planned for teams in the future, so stay tuned for things like:\n\n- Roles and Permissions\n- Audit Logs\n- More cat pictures\n\nGo team!\n\n## Data Models\n\n###### Team Object\n\n| field         | type                                                                              | description                            |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| icon          | ?string                                                                           | a hash of the image of the team's icon |\n| id            | snowflake                                                                         | the unique id of the team              |\n| members       | array of [team member](#DOCS_TOPICS_TEAMS/data-models-team-member-object) objects | the members of the team                |\n| name          | string                                                                            | the name of the team                   |\n| owner_user_id | snowflake                                                                         | the user id of the current team owner  |\n\n###### Team Member Object\n\n| field            | type                                                    | description                                                                                     |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| membership_state | integer                                                 | the user's [membership state](#DOCS_TOPICS_TEAMS/data-models-membership-state-enum) on the team |\n| permissions      | array of strings                                        | will always be `[\"*\"]`                                                                          |\n| team_id          | snowflake                                               | the id of the parent team of which they are a member                                            |\n| user             | partial [user](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/user-object) object | the avatar, discriminator, id, and username of the user                                         |\n\n###### Membership State Enum\n\n| name     | value |\n| -------- | ----- |\n| INVITED  | 1     |\n| ACCEPTED | 2     |\n"

e.exports="# Threads\n\n[Threads](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) are a new Discord feature. Threads can be thought of as temporary sub-channels inside an existing channel, to help better organize conversation in a busy channel.\n\nThreads have been designed to be very similar to [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) objects, and this topic aggregates all of the information about threads, which should all help to make migrating very straightforward.\n\n## Backwards Compatibility\n\nThreads are only available in API v9. Bots that do not update to API v9 will not receive most gateway events for threads, or things that happen in threads (such as [Message Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create)). Bots on APIv8 will still receive gateway events for Interactions though.\n\nThe list of gateway events that may be dropped includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- MESSAGE_CREATE\n- MESSAGE_DELETE\n- MESSAGE_DELETE_BULK\n- MESSAGE_REACTION_ADD\n- MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE\n- MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_ALL\n- MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_EMOJI\n- MESSAGE_UPDATE\n- THREAD_CREATE\n- THREAD_UPDATE\n- THREAD_DELETE\n- THREAD_MEMBER_UPDATE\n- THREAD_MEMBERS_UPDATE\n\n## New Thread Fields\n\nSince threads are a new [type of channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-channel-types), they share and re-purpose a number of the existing fields on a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object:\n\n- `id`, `guild_id`, `type`, `name`, `last_message_id`, `last_pin_timestamp`, `rate_limit_per_user` are being re-used\n- `owner_id` has been repurposed to store the id of the user that started the thread\n- `parent_id` has been repurposed to store the id of the `GUILD_TEXT` or `GUILD_NEWS` channel the thread was created in\n\nAdditionally, there are a few new fields that are only available on threads:\n\n- `message_count` and `member_count` store an approximate count, but they stop counting at 50 (these are only used in our UI, so likely are not valuable to bots)\n- `thread_metadata` contains a few thread specific fields, `archived`, `archive_timestamp`, `auto_archive_duration`, `locked`. `archive_timestamp` is changed when creating, archiving, or unarchiving a thread, and when changing the `auto_archive_duration` field.\n\n## Public & Private Threads\n\nPublic threads are viewable by everyone who can view the parent channel of the thread. Public threads must be created from an existing message, but can be \"orphaned\" if that message is deleted. The created thread and the message it was started from will share the same id. The [type](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-channel-types) of thread created matches the [type](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-channel-types) of the parent channel. `GUILD_TEXT` channels [create](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/start-thread-with-message) `GUILD_PUBLIC_THREAD` and `GUILD_NEWS` channels [create](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/start-thread-with-message) `GUILD_NEWS_THREAD`.\n\nPrivate threads behave similar to Group DMs, but in a Guild. Private threads are always [created](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/start-thread-without-message) with the `GUILD_PRIVATE_THREAD` [type](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-channel-types) and can only be created in `GUILD_TEXT` channels.\n\n## Active & Archived Threads\n\nEvery thread can be either active or archived. Changing a thread from archived -> active is referred to as unarchiving the thread. Threads that have `locked` set to true can only be unarchived by a user with the `MANAGE_THREADS` permission.\n\nBesides helping to de-clutter the UI for users, archiving exists to limit the working set of threads that need to be kept around. Since the number of archived threads can be quite large, keeping all of them in memory may be quite prohibitive. Therefore guilds are capped at a certain number of active threads, and only active threads can be manipulated. Users cannot edit messages, add reactions, use application commands, or join archived threads. The only operation that should happen within an archived thread is messages being deleted. Sending a message will automatically unarchive the thread, unless the thread has been locked by a moderator.\n\nBecause of this constraint, the gateway protocol is designed to ensure that bots are able to have an accurate view of the full set of active threads, but archived threads are not synced up-front via the gateway.\n\nThreads do not count against the max-channels limit in a guild, but there will be a new limit on the maximum number of active threads in a guild.\n\nThreads automatically archive after inactivity. \"Activity\" is defined as sending a message, unarchiving a thread, or changing the auto-archive time. Bots can control how long a thread can be inactive with the `auto_archive_duration` field. Channels can also set `default_auto_archive_duration`, which is primarily used by our clients to pre-select a different auto-archive duration when a user starts the thread creation flow.\n\n## Permissions\n\nThreads generally inherit permissions from the parent channel. If you can add reactions in the parent channel, you can do that in a thread as well.\n\nThree new permission bits have been added, `CREATE_PUBLIC_THREADS`, `CREATE_PRIVATE_THREADS`, and `SEND_MESSAGES_IN_THREADS`. Note: `SEND_MESSAGES` has no effect in threads, users must have `SEND_MESSAGES_IN_THREADS` to talk in a thread.\n\nPrivate threads are similar to Group DMs, but in a guild: You must be invited to the thread to be able to view or participate in it, or be a moderator (`MANAGE_THREADS` permission).\n\nFinally, threads are treated slightly differently from channels in the gateway protocol. Clients will not be informed of a thread through the gateway if they do not have permission to view that thread.\n\n## Gateway Events\n\n- [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) contains a new field, `threads`, which is an array of channel objects. This represents all active threads in the guild, that the current user is able to view.\n- When a thread is created, updated, or deleted, a [Thread Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-create), [Thread Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-update), or [Thread Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-delete) event is sent. Like their channel counterparts, these just contain a thread.\n- Since the gateway only syncs active threads that the user can see, if a user _gains_ access to a channel, then the gateway may need to sync the active threads in that channel to the user. It will send a [Thread List Sync](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-list-sync) event for this.\n\n## Thread Membership\n\nEach thread tracks explicit membership. There are two primary use cases for this data:\n\n- Clients use _their own_ [thread member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/thread-member-object) to calculate read states and notification settings. This is largely irrelevant for bots though, but is the reason for some of the syncing complexity detailed here.\n- Knowing everyone that is in a thread.\n\nMembership is tracked in an array of [thread member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/thread-member-object) objects. These have four fields, `id` (the thread id), `user_id`, `join_timestamp`, and `flags`. Currently the only `flags` are for notification settings, but others may be added in future updates.\n\n### Syncing for the current user\n\n- A [Thread Members Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-members-update) Gateway Event is always sent when the current user is added to or removed from a thread.\n- A [Thread Member Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-member-update) Gateway Event is sent whenever the current user's [thread member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/thread-member-object) object is updated.\n- Certain API calls, such as listing archived threads and search will return an array of [thread member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/thread-member-object) objects for any returned threads the current user is a member of. Other API calls, such as getting a channel will return the [thread member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/thread-member-object) object for the current user as a property on the channel, if the current user is a member of the thread.\n- The [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) Gateway Event will contain a [thread member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/thread-member-object) object as a property on any returned threads the current is a member of.\n- The [Thread Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-create) Gateway Event will contain a [thread member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/thread-member-object) object as a property of the thread if the current user is a member of, and the user has recently gained access to view the parent channel.\n- The [Thread List Sync](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-list-sync) Gateway Event will contain an array of [thread member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/thread-member-object) objects for any returned threads the current user is a member of.\n\n### Syncing for other users\n\n> info\n> These require the `GUILD_MEMBERS` [Gateway Intent](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents)\n\n- An API `GET` call to [`/channels/<channel_id>/thread-members`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/list-thread-members) which returns an array of [thread member](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/thread-member-object) objects.\n- The [Thread Members Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-members-update) Gateway Event which will include all users who were added to or removed from a thread by an action.\n\n## Editing & Deleting Threads\n\nThreads can be edited and deleted with the existing `PATCH` and `DELETE` endpoints to edit a channel.\n\n- Deleting a thread requires the `MANAGE_THREADS` permission.\n- Editing a thread to set `archived` to `false` only requires the current user has already been added to the thread. If `locked` is true, then the user must have `MANAGE_THREADS`\n- Editing a thread to change the `name`, `archived`, `auto_archive_duration` fields requires `MANAGE_THREADS` or that the current user is the thread creator\n- Editing a thread to change `rate_limit_per_user` or `locked` requires `MANAGE_THREADS`\n\n## NSFW Threads\n\nThreads do not explicitly set the `nsfw` field. All threads in a channel marked as `nsfw` inherit that setting though.\n\n## New Message Types\n\nThreads introduce a few new [message types](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object-message-types), and re-purpose some others:\n\n- `RECIPIENT_ADD` and `RECIPIENT_REMOVE` have been repurposed to also send when a user is added to or removed from a thread by someone else\n- `CHANNEL_NAME_CHANGE` has been repurposed and is sent when the thread's name is changed\n- `THREAD_CREATED` is a new message sent to the parent `GUILD_TEXT` channel, used to inform users that a thread has been created. It is currently only sent in one case: when a `GUILD_PUBLIC_THREAD` is created from an older message (older is still TBD, but is currently set to a very small value). The message contains a [message reference](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-reference-object-message-reference-structure) with the `guild_id` and `channel_id` of the thread. The `content` of the message is the `name` of the thread.\n- `THREAD_STARTER_MESSAGE` is a new message sent as the first message in threads that are started from an existing message in the parent channel. It _only_ contains a [message reference](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-reference-object-message-reference-structure) field that points to the message from which the thread was started.\n\n## Enumerating threads\n\nThere are four new `GET` routes for enumerating threads in a specific channel:\n\n- [`/guilds/<guild_id>/threads/active`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/list-active-threads) returns all active threads in a guild that the current user can access, includes public & private threads\n- [`/channels/<channel_id>/users/@me/threads/archived/private`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/list-joined-private-archived-threads) returns all archived, private threads in a channel, that the current user has is a member of, sorted by thread id descending\n- [`/channels/<channel_id>/threads/archived/public`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/list-public-archived-threads) returns all archived, public threads in a channel, sorted by archive timestamp descending\n- [`/channels/<channel_id>/threads/archived/private`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/list-private-archived-threads) returns all archived, private threads in a channel, sorted by archive timestamp descending\n\n## Webhooks\n\nWebhooks can send messages to threads by using the `thread_id` query parameter. See the [execute webhook](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK/execute-webhook) docs for more details.\n\n## Additional context on the the THREAD_LIST_SYNC and THREAD_CREATE dispatches\n\nWhile threads are mostly similar to channels in terms of structure and how they are synced, there are two important product requirements that lead to differences in how threads and channels are synced. This section helps explain the behavior behind the [Thread List Sync](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-list-sync) and [Thread Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-create) dispatches by going over those problems and how they are solved.\n\nThe two product requirements are: The gateway will only sync threads to a client that the client has permission to view, and it will only sync those threads once the client has \"subscribed\" to the guild. For context, in Discord's official clients, a subscription happens when the user visits a channel in the guild.\n\nAs mentioned, these lead to a couple of edge cases that are worth going into:\n\n### Gaining access to a private thread\n\nWhen a client is added to a private thread, they likely don't have that private thread in memory yet because of the product requirement that we only sync threads you have permission to view. Private threads are only synced to you if you are a member or a moderator. To solve this, whenever a user is added to a private thread, the gateway also sends a [Thread Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-create) dispatch. This ensures the client always has a non-null value for that thread. Note: This is also sent even if the user is a moderator, and thus would already have the channel in memory, mainly for simplicity purposes.\n\n### Gaining access to a public thread\n\nWhen a client is added to a public thread, but has not yet subscribed to threads, they might not have that public thread in memory yet. This is actually only a problem for Discord's official clients, and not for bots. The gateway will auto-subscribe bots to all thread dispatches and active threads on connect. But Discord's clients only receive threads that are active and they have also joined on connect in order to reduce the amount of data needed on initial connect. But this means when a user with the official client is added to a thread, that thread now becomes an \"active-joined\" thread and needs to be synced to the client. To solve this, whenever a user is added to _any_ thread, the gateway also sends a [Thread Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-create) dispatch.\n\n### Gaining access to a channel\n\nWhen a client gains access to a channel (example: they _gain_ the moderator role, and thus now they have more channels they can view), they won't have any of the threads in memory for that channel (since the gateway only syncs threads that the client has permission to view). To solve this, we send the [Thread List Sync](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-list-sync) dispatch to a client when they gain access to a channel! This dispatch includes a `channel_ids` array, which is the id of all the channels whose threads are being synced. This field can be used to first clear out any active threads whose `parent_id` is in the `channel_ids` array, and then ingest any threads that were in the dispatch.\n\n### Losing access to a channel\n\nWhen a client loses access to a channel, the gateway does not send them a [Thread Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-delete) event or any equivalent. They will still receive _an_ event when this happens, it just will not be a thread-specific event. Usually the event wil be [Guild Role Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-role-update), [Guild Member Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-member-update) or [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-update). It will be some event that caused the permissions on a channel to change. So _if_ a bot wanted to simulate a \"lost access to thread\" event, it is entirely possible, albeit quite complicated to handle all cases correctly. Under the hood, Discord's clients actually don't worry about this detail. Instead, when performing an action, the client checks permissions first (which implicitly checks if the client has access to the parent channel too, since threads inherit permissions), that way _even if_ the client has some stale data, it does not end up acting on it.\n\nAdditionally, when a client loses access to a channel they are not removed from the thread. Users may want to temporarily shut down access to a server or channel. Removing someone from all threads when that happens would not be a good experience, so we've chosen not to go that route. Users will still be reported as members of a thread, even if they no longer have access to the parent channel. They will **not** receive new gateway events for those threads though, with one exception: If a client is removed from a thread _after_ losing access to the parent channel, they will still receive a [Thread Members Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-members-update) dispatch.\n\n### Unarchiving a thread\n\nDiscord's clients only load active threads into memory on start. So when a thread is unarchived, there is no guarantee that the client has either the thread or whether they are a member, in memory. As such, the Gateway sends a [Thread Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-update) first, which contains the full channel object. And then sends a [Thread Member Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/thread-member-update) to each member of the thread, so those clients know they are a member, and what their notification setting is. This event is not that valuable for bots right now, but is going to be received by bots, so is documented here none the less.\n"

e.exports='# Voice\n\nVoice connections operate in a similar fashion to the [Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways) connection. However, they use a different set of payloads and a separate UDP-based connection for voice data transmission. Because UDP is used for both receiving and transmitting voice data, your client _must_ be able to receive UDP packets, even through a firewall or NAT (see [UDP Hole Punching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching) for more information). The Discord Voice servers implement functionality (see [IP Discovery](#DOCS_TOPICS_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/ip-discovery)) for discovering the local machines remote UDP IP/Port, which can assist in some network configurations.\n\n## Voice Gateway Versioning\n\nTo ensure that you have the most up-to-date information, please use [version 4](#DOCS_TOPICS_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/voice-gateway-versioning-gateway-versions). Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the [Opcodes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) documented here will reflect what you receive over the socket.\n\n###### Gateway Versions\n\n| Version | Status      | WebSocket URL Append |\n| ------- | ----------- | -------------------- |\n| 4       | recommended | ?v=4                 |\n| 3       | available   | ?v=3                 |\n| 2       | available   | ?v=2                 |\n| 1       | default     | ?v=1 or omit         |\n\n## Connecting to Voice\n\n### Retrieving Voice Server Information\n\nThe first step in connecting to a voice server (and in turn, a guild\'s voice channel) is formulating a request that can be sent to the [Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways), which will return information about the voice server we will connect to. Because Discord\'s voice platform is widely distributed, users **should never** cache or save the results of this call. To inform the gateway of our intent to establish voice connectivity, we first send an [Opcode 4 Gateway Voice State Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway):\n\n###### Gateway Voice State Update Example\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 4,\n  "d": {\n    "guild_id": "41771983423143937",\n    "channel_id": "127121515262115840",\n    "self_mute": false,\n    "self_deaf": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf our request succeeded, the gateway will respond with _two_ events—a [Voice State Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/voice-state-update) event and a [Voice Server Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/voice-server-update) event—meaning your library must properly wait for both events before continuing. The first will contain a new key, `session_id`, and the second will provide voice server information we can use to establish a new voice connection:\n\n###### Example Voice Server Update Payload\n\n```json\n{\n  "t": "VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE",\n  "s": 2,\n  "op": 0,\n  "d": {\n    "token": "my_token",\n    "guild_id": "41771983423143937",\n    "endpoint": "smart.loyal.discord.gg"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this information, we can move on to establishing a voice WebSocket connection.\n\n> info\n> Bot users respect the voice channel\'s user limit, if set. When the voice channel is full, you will not receive\n> the Voice State Update or Voice Server Update events in response to your own Voice State Update. Having `MANAGE_CHANNELS`\n> permission bypasses this limit and allows you to join regardless of the channel being full or not.\n\n## Establishing a Voice Websocket Connection\n\nOnce we retrieve a session_id, token, and endpoint information, we can connect and handshake with the voice server over another secure WebSocket. Unlike the gateway endpoint we receive in an HTTP [Get Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway) request, the endpoint received from our [Voice Server Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/voice-server-update) payload does not contain a URL protocol, so some libraries may require manually prepending it with "wss://" before connecting. Once connected to the voice WebSocket endpoint, we can send an [Opcode 0 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) payload with our server_id, user_id, session_id, and token:\n\n###### Example Voice Identify Payload\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 0,\n  "d": {\n    "server_id": "41771983423143937",\n    "user_id": "104694319306248192",\n    "session_id": "my_session_id",\n    "token": "my_token"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe voice server should respond with an [Opcode 2 Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) payload, which informs us of the `SSRC`, UDP IP/port, and supported encryption modes the voice server expects:\n\n###### Example Voice Ready Payload\n\n```json\n{\n    "op": 2,\n    "d": {\n        "ssrc": 1,\n        "ip": "127.0.0.1",\n        "port": 1234,\n        "modes": ["xsalsa20_poly1305", "xsalsa20_poly1305_suffix", "xsalsa20_poly1305_lite"],\n        "heartbeat_interval": 1\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> danger\n> `heartbeat_interval` here is an erroneous field and should be ignored. The correct `heartbeat_interval` value comes from the Hello payload.\n\n## Heartbeating\n\nIn order to maintain your WebSocket connection, you need to continuously send heartbeats at the interval determined in [Opcode 8 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice):\n\n###### Example Hello Payload below V3\n\n```json\n{\n  "heartbeat_interval": 41250\n}\n```\n\n###### Example Hello Payload since V3\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 8,\n  "d": {\n    "heartbeat_interval": 41250\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is sent at the start of the connection. Be warned that the [Opcode 8 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) structure differs by gateway version as shown in the above examples. Versions below v3 do not have an opcode or a data field denoted by `d`. V3 and above was updated to be structured like other payloads. Be sure to expect this different format based on your version.\n\nAfter receiving [Opcode 8 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice), you should send [Opcode 3 Heartbeat](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice)—which contains an integer nonce—every elapsed interval:\n\n###### Example Heartbeat Payload\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 3,\n  "d": 1501184119561\n}\n```\n\nIn return, you will be sent back an [Opcode 6 Heartbeat ACK](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) that contains the previously sent nonce:\n\n###### Example Heartbeat ACK Payload\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 6,\n  "d": 1501184119561\n}\n```\n\n## Establishing a Voice UDP Connection\n\nOnce we receive the properties of a UDP voice server from our [Opcode 2 Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) payload, we can proceed to the final step of voice connections, which entails establishing and handshaking a UDP connection for voice data. First, we open a UDP connection to the IP and port provided in the Ready payload. If required, we can now perform an [IP Discovery](#DOCS_TOPICS_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/ip-discovery) using this connection. Once we\'ve fully discovered our external IP and UDP port, we can then tell the voice WebSocket what it is, and start receiving/sending data. We do this using [Opcode 1 Select Protocol](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice):\n\n###### Example Select Protocol Payload\n\n```json\n{\n    "op": 1,\n    "d": {\n        "protocol": "udp",\n        "data": {\n            "address": "127.0.0.1",\n            "port": 1337,\n            "mode": "xsalsa20_poly1305_lite"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n###### Encryption Modes\n\n| Mode   | Key                      | Nonce Bytes                                                            | Generating Nonce                      |\n|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Normal | xsalsa20_poly1305        | The nonce bytes are the RTP header                                     | Copy the RTP header                   |\n| Suffix | xsalsa20_poly1305_suffix | The nonce bytes are 24 bytes appended to the payload of the RTP packet | Generate 24 random bytes              |\n| Lite   | xsalsa20_poly1305_lite   | The nonce bytes are 4 bytes appended to the payload of the RTP packet  | Incremental 4 bytes (32bit) int value |\n\n>warn\n>The nonce has to be stripped from the payload before encrypting and before decrypting the audio data\n\nFinally, the voice server will respond with a [Opcode 4 Session Description](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) that includes the `mode` and `secret_key`, a 32 byte array used for [encrypting and sending](#DOCS_TOPICS_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/encrypting-and-sending-voice) voice data:\n\n###### Example Session Description Payload\n\n```json\n{\n    "op": 4,\n    "d": {\n        "mode": "xsalsa20_poly1305_lite",\n        "secret_key": [ ...251, 100, 11...]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe can now start encrypting and sending voice data over the previously established UDP connection.\n\n## Encrypting and Sending Voice\n\nVoice data sent to discord should be encoded with [Opus](https://www.opus-codec.org/), using two channels (stereo) and a sample rate of 48kHz. Voice Data is sent using a [RTP Header](https://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc3550_line548), followed by encrypted Opus audio data. Voice encryption uses the key passed in [Opcode 4 Session Description](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) and the nonce formed with the 12 byte header appended with 12 null bytes to achieve the 24 required by xsalsa20_poly1305. Discord encrypts with the [libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/) encryption library.\n\n###### Voice Packet Structure\n\n| Field           | Type                          | Size    |\n| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |\n| Version + Flags | Single byte value of `0x80`   | 1 byte  |\n| Payload Type    | Single byte value of `0x78`   | 1 byte  |\n| Sequence        | Unsigned short (big endian)   | 2 bytes |\n| Timestamp       | Unsigned integer (big endian) | 4 bytes |\n| SSRC            | Unsigned integer (big endian) | 4 bytes |\n| Encrypted audio | Binary data                   | n bytes |\n\n## Speaking\n\nTo notify clients that you are speaking or have stopped speaking, send an [Opcode 5 Speaking](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) payload:\n\nThe following flags can be used as a bitwise mask. For example `5` would be priority and voice.\n\n| Flag       | Meaning                                                        | Value  |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |\n| Microphone | Normal transmission of voice audio                             | 1 << 0 |\n| Soundshare | Transmission of context audio for video, no speaking indicator | 1 << 1 |\n| Priority   | Priority speaker, lowering audio of other speakers             | 1 << 2 |\n\n###### Example Speaking Payload\n\n```json\n{\n    "op": 5,\n    "d": {\n        "speaking": 5,\n        "delay": 0,\n        "ssrc": 1\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> warn\n> You must send at least one [Opcode 5 Speaking](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) payload before sending voice data, or you will be disconnected with an invalid SSRC error.\n\n### Voice Data Interpolation\n\nWhen there\'s a break in the sent data, the packet transmission shouldn\'t simply stop. Instead, send five frames of silence (`0xF8, 0xFF, 0xFE`) before stopping to avoid unintended Opus interpolation with subsequent transmissions.\n\n## Resuming Voice Connection\n\nWhen your client detects that its connection has been severed, it should open a new WebSocket connection. Once the new connection has been opened, your client should send an [Opcode 7 Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) payload:\n\n###### Example Resume Connection Payload\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 7,\n  "d": {\n    "server_id": "41771983423143937",\n    "session_id": "my_session_id",\n    "token": "my_token"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf successful, the Voice server will respond with an [Opcode 9 Resumed](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice) to signal that your client is now resumed:\n\n###### Example Resumed Payload\n\n```json\n{\n  "op": 9,\n  "d": null\n}\n```\n\nIf the resume is unsuccessful—for example, due to an invalid session—the WebSocket connection will close with the appropriate [close event code](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/voice-voice-close-event-codes). You should then follow the [Connecting](#DOCS_TOPICS_VOICE_CONNECTIONS/connecting-to-voice) flow to reconnect.\n\n#### IP Discovery\n\nGenerally routers on the Internet mask or obfuscate UDP ports through a process called NAT. Most users who implement voice will want to utilize IP discovery to find their external IP and port which will then be used for receiving voice communications. To retrieve your external IP and port, send the following UDP packet to your voice port (all numeric are big endian):\n\n| Field           | Description                                                    | Size     |\n| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| Type            | Values 0x1 and 0x2 indicate request and response, respectively | 2 bytes  |\n| Length          | Message length excluding Type and Length fields (value 70)     | 2 bytes  |\n| SSRC            | Unsigned integer                                               | 4 bytes  |\n| Address         | Null-terminated string in response                             | 64 bytes |\n| Port            | Unsigned short                                                 | 2 bytes  |\n\n'
