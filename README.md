# FAQ

Q: Why do I need a extension?

A: Discord blocks other sites using CORS and only extensions will work, you could also host a CORS proxy, which isn't recommended since the person hosting is more likely to get IP banned rather than the person actually using it

Q: Antivirus flags your files

A: I don't have the money to pay for a 3yr Digicert Certificate to sign all of my Windows binaries, even if I did, would it be a waste? (EXEs are currently unsigned)
