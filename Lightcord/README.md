# Running From Source

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM
To run from source, follow these instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lightcord/Lightcord
cd Lightcord
npm run devInstall
npm test
```

*You will have to do that every time you pull/clone*

Lightcord will then launch. If you see the Lightcord icon, you're good to go!

Any time you want to launch, just run:

```bash
npm start
```
